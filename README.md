# The HTML 5.1 release branch (html5.1)

This is the repository for the [HTML 5.1 Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/2016/REC-html51-20161101/). 
This repository is managed by the [W3C Web Platform Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/).

## Building the spec

The specification is built using Bikeshed. If you would like to propose edits, please make sure that 
they result in a specification that will build correctly, by testing in your own clone of the 
repository.

1. Install [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed)

   **Important:** this spec was built using a snapshot of the bikeshed tool

2. From the bikeshed folder open a command prompt
3. Checkout the commit used to build this branch:

   `git checkout 0dca46a2874cdca2aa5e27d33d9a000f1e1b6e45`
4. Switch to the html folder in this branch (still in the command prompt)
5. Copy the archived spec-data folder from html into bikeshed: 
   
   `cp -R .spec-data/* `[path to bikeshed repo]`/bikeshed/spec-data`

6. run bikeshed: `bikeshed spec`

For the multipage version, one can do as follows:

1. Install [multipage](https://github.com/adrianba/multipage)
2. Follow the instructions there to regenerate the HTML files

## HTML branching and versioning

The `master` branch of this repository always contains the **work in progress** version of the HTML specification. This branch always welcomes substantive and editorial changes and pull requests.

The `master` branch is always exposed at [https://www.w3.org/TR/html/](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/).

Once a year, the HTML editors create a new `<version>` branch for the HTML specification. It only contains features that the Working Group believes can be shipped as part of the W3C Recommendation. That branch becomes associated with a specific version of the HTML specification. For a *limited period* of time, the Editor Team only accepts editorial changes or removal of features at risks in this branch. It becomes frozen once that version of HTML becomes a W3C Recommendation. Unless you're targetting a specific version of HTML (and really, you shouldn't), pull requests MUST always be made against the `master` branch.

The `<version>` branches are exposed as /TR/html`<version>`/ .

## Old HTML repository

The [old HTML repo](https://github.com/w3c/html-old) is available for archival purposes.
