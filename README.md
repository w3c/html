# HTML

This is the repository for the [Working Draft of the HTML specification](https://w3c.github.io/html/). This repository is managed by the [W3C Web Platform Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/).

## Editorial Documentation

The specification is built using Bikeshed. If you would like to propose edits, please make sure that they result in a specification that will build correctly, by testing in your own clone of the repository.

1. Install [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed)
2. From the HTML folder open a command prompt
3. run bikeshed: `'bikeshed spec'`

For the multipage version, one can do as follows:

1. Install [html-tools](https://github.com/w3c/html-tools)
2. Follow the instructions there to regenerate the HTML files
