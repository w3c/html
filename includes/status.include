<p>The Working Group aims to make this specification reflect the "leading edge" of what is interoperably deployed as HTML. Features which are shown not to have implementation may be removed from this specification.</p>

<p>The Working Group also has a goal, to the extent possible, of modularising the HTML specification.</p>

<p>The Web Platform Working Group expects to recharter in late 2016 and produce an HTML 5.2 Recommendation in late 2017.</p>
