# Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct

* * *

W3C is a **growing and global community** where participants choose to work together, and in that process experience differences in language, location, nationality, and experience. In such a diverse environment, misunderstandings and disagreements happen, which in most cases can be resolved informally. In rare cases, however, behavior can intimidate, harass, or otherwise disrupt one or more people in the community, which W3C will not tolerate.

A [**Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct**](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/) is useful to define accepted and acceptable behaviors and to promote high standards of professional practice. It also provides a benchmark for self evaluation and acts as a vehicle for better identity of the organization.

This code (**CEPC**), complemented by a set of [Procedures](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures), applies to any member of the W3C community â€“ staff, members, invited experts, participants in W3C meetings, W3C teleconferences, W3C mailing lists, W3C conference or W3C functions, etc. Note that this code complements rather than replaces legal rights and obligations pertaining to any particular situation.

[Education and training materials](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/#Education) are available from the [Positive Work Environment public homepage](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/).

## <a name="Statement" id="Statement">Statement</a> of Intent

W3C is committed to maintain a **positive** work environment. This commitment calls for a workplace where [participants](#Participant) at all levels **behave** according to the rules of the following code. A foundational concept of this code is that **we all share responsibility** for our [work environment](#Work).

## <a name="Code" id="Code">Code</a>

1.  Treat each other with [respect](#Respect), professionalism, fairness, and sensitivity to our many differences and strengths, including in situations of high pressure and urgency.
2.  Never [harass](#Harassment) or [bully](#Workplace) anyone verbally, physically or [sexually](#Sexual).
3.  Never [discriminate](#Discrimination) on the basis of personal characteristics or group membership.
4.  Communicate constructively and avoid [demeaning](#Demeaning) or [insulting](#Insulting) behavior or language.
5.  Seek, accept, and offer objective work criticism, and [acknowledge](#Acknowledgement) properly the contributions of others.
6.  Be honest about your own qualifications, and about any circumstances that might lead to [conflicts of interest](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies.html#coi).
7.  Respect the [privacy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/process.html#confidentiality-levels) of others and the [confidentiality](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/process.html#confidentiality-levels) of data you access.
8.  With respect to cultural differences, be conservative in what you do and liberal in what you accept from others, but not to the point of accepting disrespectful, unprofessional or unfair or [unwelcome behavior](#Unwelcome) or [advances](#Advance).
9.  Promote the rules of this Code and take action (especially if you are in a [leadership position](#Leadership)) to bring the discussion back to a more civil level whenever inappropriate behaviors are observed.
