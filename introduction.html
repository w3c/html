    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>The World Wide Web’s markup language has always been HTML. HTML was primarily designed as a
  language for semantically describing scientific documents, although its general design and
  adaptations over the years have enabled it to be used to describe a number of other types of
  documents.</p>
    <p>The main area that has not been adequately addressed by HTML is a vague subject referred to as Web
  Applications. This standard attempts to rectify this, while at the same time updating the HTML
  language to address issues raised in the past few years.</p>
    <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="1.2" id="audience"><span class="secno">1.2. </span><span class="content">Audience</span><a class="self-link" href="introduction.html#audience"></a></h3>
    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>This specification is intended for authors of documents and scripts that use the features defined
  in this specification<span class="impl">, implementors of tools that operate on pages that use the
  features defined in this specification, and individuals wishing to establish the correctness of
  documents or implementations with respect to the requirements of this specification</span>.</p>
    <p>This document is probably not suited to readers who do not already have at least a passing
  familiarity with Web technologies, as in places it sacrifices clarity for precision, and brevity
  for completeness. More approachable tutorials and authoring guides can provide a gentler
  introduction to the topic.</p>
    <p>In particular, familiarity with the basics of DOM is necessary for a complete understanding of
  some of the more technical parts of this specification. An understanding of Web IDL, HTTP, XML,
  Unicode, character encodings, JavaScript, and CSS will also be helpful in places but is not
  essential.</p>
    <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="1.3" id="scope"><span class="secno">1.3. </span><span class="content">Scope</span><a class="self-link" href="introduction.html#scope"></a></h3>
    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>This specification is limited to providing a semantic-level markup language and associated
  semantic-level scripting APIs for authoring accessible pages on the Web ranging from static
  documents to dynamic applications.</p>
    <p>The scope of this specification does not include providing mechanisms for media-specific
  customization of presentation (although default rendering rules for Web browsers are included at
  the end of this specification, and several mechanisms for hooking into CSS are provided as part
  of the language).</p>
    <p>The scope of this specification is not to describe an entire operating system. In particular,
  hardware configuration software, image manipulation tools, and applications that users would be
  expected to use with high-end workstations on a daily basis are out of scope. In terms of
  applications, this specification is targeted specifically at applications that would be expected
  to be used by users on an occasional basis, or regularly but from disparate locations, with low
  CPU requirements. Examples of such applications include online purchasing systems, searching
  systems, games (especially multiplayer online games), public telephone books or address books,
  communications software (e-mail clients, instant messaging clients, discussion software),
  document editing software, etc.</p>
    <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="1.4" id="introduction-history"><span class="secno">1.4. </span><span class="content">History</span><a class="self-link" href="introduction.html#introduction-history"></a></h3>
    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>For its first five years (1990-1995), HTML went through a number of revisions and experienced a
  number of extensions, primarily hosted first at CERN, and then at the IETF.</p>
    <p>With the creation of the W3C, HTML’s development changed venue again. A first abortive attempt at
  extending HTML in 1995 known as HTML 3.0 then made way to a more pragmatic approach known as
  HTML3.2, which was completed in 1997. HTML4 quickly followed later that same year.</p>
    <p>The following year, the W3C membership decided to stop evolving HTML and instead begin work on
  an XML-based equivalent, called XHTML. This effort started with a reformulation of HTML4 in XML,
  known as XHTML 1.0, which added no new features except the new serialization, and which was
  completed in 2000. After XHTML 1.0, the W3C’s focus turned to making it easier for other working
  groups to extend XHTML, under the banner of XHTML Modularization. In parallel with this, the W3C
  also worked on a new language that was not compatible with the earlier HTML and XHTML languages,
  calling it XHTML2.</p>
    <p>Around the time that HTML’s evolution was stopped in 1998, parts of the API for HTML developed
  by browser vendors were specified and published under the name DOM Level 1 (in 1998) and DOM
  Level 2 Core and DOM Level 2 HTML (starting in 2000 and culminating in 2003). These efforts then
  petered out, with some DOM Level 3 specifications published in 2004 but the working group being
  closed before all the Level 3 drafts were completed.</p>
    <p>In 2003, the publication of XForms, a technology which was positioned as the next generation of
  Web forms, sparked a renewed interest in evolving HTML itself, rather than finding replacements
  for it. This interest was borne from the realization that XML’s deployment as a Web technology was
  limited to entirely new technologies (like RSS and later Atom), rather than as a replacement for
  existing deployed technologies (like HTML).</p>
    <p>A proof of concept to show that it was possible to extend HTML4’s forms to provide many of the
  features that XForms 1.0 introduced, without requiring browsers to implement rendering engines
  that were incompatible with existing HTML Web pages, was the first result of this renewed
  interest. At this early stage, while the draft was already publicly available, and input was
  already being solicited from all sources, the specification was only under Opera Software’s
  copyright.</p>
    <p>The idea that HTML’s evolution should be reopened was tested at a W3C workshop in 2004, where
  some of the principles that underlie the HTML5 work (described below), as well as the
  aforementioned early draft proposal covering just forms-related features, were presented to the
  W3C jointly by Mozilla and Opera. The proposal was rejected on the grounds that the proposal
  conflicted with the previously chosen direction for the Web’s evolution; the W3C staff and
  membership voted to continue developing XML-based replacements instead.</p>
    <p>Shortly thereafter, Apple, Mozilla, and Opera jointly announced their intent to continue working
  on the effort under the umbrella of a new venue called the WHATWG. A public mailing list was
  created, and the draft was moved to the WHATWG site. The copyright was subsequently amended to be
  jointly owned by all three vendors, and to allow reuse of the specification.</p>
    <p>The WHATWG was based on several core principles, in particular that technologies need to be
  backwards compatible, that specifications and implementations need to match even if this means
  changing the specification rather than the implementations, and that specifications need to be
  detailed enough that implementations can achieve complete interoperability without
  reverse-engineering each other.</p>
    <p>The latter requirement in particular required that the scope of the HTML5 specification include
  what had previously been specified in three separate documents: HTML4, XHTML1, and DOM2 HTML. It
  also meant including significantly more detail than had previously been considered the norm.</p>
    <p>In 2006, the W3C indicated an interest to participate in the development of HTML5 after all, and
  in 2007 formed a working group chartered to work with the WHATWG on the development of the HTML5
  specification. Apple, Mozilla, and Opera allowed the W3C to publish the specification under the
  W3C copyright, while keeping a version with the less restrictive license on the WHATWG site.</p>
    <p>For a number of years, both groups then worked together under the same editor: Ian Hickson. In
  2011, the groups came to the conclusion that they had different goals: the W3C wanted to draw a
  line in the sand for features for a HTML5 Recommendation, while the WHATWG wanted to continue
  working on a Living Standard for HTML, continuously maintaining the specification and adding new
  features. In mid 2012, a new editing team was introduced at the W3C to take care of creating a
  HTML5 Recommendation and prepare a Working Draft for the next HTML version.</p>
    <p>Since then, the W3C HTML WG has been cherry picking patches from the WHATWG that resolved bugs
  registered on the W3C HTML specification or more accurately represented implemented reality in
  user agents. At time of publication of this document, patches from the <a data-link-type="dfn" href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#">WHATWG HTML specification</a> have been merged until revision <a data-link-type="dfn" href="http://html5.org/r/8424/#">8424</a> inclusive. The W3C HTML editors have also added
  patches that resulted from discussions and decisions made by the W3C HTML WG as well a bug fixes
  from bugs not shared by the WHATWG.</p>
    <p>A separate document is published to document the differences between the HTML specified in this
  document and the language described in the HTML4 specification. <a data-link-type="biblio" href="references.html#biblio-html5-diff">[HTML5-DIFF]</a></p>
    <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="1.5" id="design-notes"><span class="secno">1.5. </span><span class="content">Design notes</span><a class="self-link" href="introduction.html#design-notes"></a></h3>
    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>It must be admitted that many aspects of HTML appear at first glance to be nonsensical and
  inconsistent.</p>
    <p>HTML, its supporting DOM APIs, as well as many of its supporting technologies, have been
  developed over a period of several decades by a wide array of people with different priorities
  who, in many cases, did not know of each other’s existence.</p>
    <p>Features have thus arisen from many sources, and have not always been designed in especially
  consistent ways. Furthermore, because of the unique characteristics of the Web, implementation
  bugs have often become de-facto, and now de-jure, standards, as content is often unintentionally
  written in ways that rely on them before they can be fixed.</p>
    <p>Despite all this, efforts have been made to adhere to certain design goals. These are described
  in the next few subsections.</p>
    <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="1.5.1" id="serializability-of-script-execution"><span class="secno">1.5.1. </span><span class="content">Serializability of script execution</span><a class="self-link" href="introduction.html#serializability-of-script-execution"></a></h4>
    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>To avoid exposing Web authors to the complexities of multithreading, the HTML and DOM APIs are
  designed such that no script can ever detect the simultaneous execution of other scripts. Even
  with <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/#worker">workers</a></code>, the intent is that the behavior of implementations
  can be thought of as completely serializing the execution of all scripts in all <a data-link-type="dfn" href="browsers.html#browsing-context">browsing contexts</a>.</p>
    <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="1.5.2" id="compliance-with-other-specifications"><span class="secno">1.5.2. </span><span class="content">Compliance with other specifications</span><a class="self-link" href="introduction.html#compliance-with-other-specifications"></a></h4>
    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>This specification interacts with and relies on a wide variety of other specifications. In certain
  circumstances, unfortunately, conflicting needs have led to this specification violating the
  requirements of these other specifications. Whenever this has occurred, the transgressions have
  each been noted as a "<dfn data-dfn-type="dfn" data-noexport="" id="willful-violation">willful violation<a class="self-link" href="introduction.html#willful-violation"></a></dfn>", and the reason for the violation has been
  noted.</p>
    <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="1.5.3" id="design-notes-extensibility"><span class="secno">1.5.3. </span><span class="content">Extensibility</span><a class="self-link" href="introduction.html#design-notes-extensibility"></a></h4>
    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>HTML has a wide array of extensibility mechanisms that can be used for adding semantics in a safe
  manner:</p>
    <ul>
     <li data-md="">
      <p>Authors can use the <code><a data-link-type="element-attr" href="dom.html#element-attrdef-global-class">class</a></code> attribute to extend elements, effectively creating their
own elements, while using the most applicable existing "real" HTML element, so that browsers and
other tools that don’t know of the extension can still support it somewhat well. This is the
tack used by microformats, for example.</p>
     </li><li data-md="">
      <p>Authors can include data for inline client-side scripts or server-side site-wide scripts to
process using the <code><a data-link-type="element-attr" href="dom.html#element-attrdef-global-data">data-*=""</a></code> attributes. These are guaranteed to never be touched
by browsers, and allow scripts to include data on HTML elements that scripts can then look for
and process.</p>
     </li><li data-md="">
      <p>Authors can use the <code>&lt;meta name="" content=""&gt;</code> mechanism to
include page-wide metadata by registering <a data-link-type="dfn" href="semantics.html#register-the-names">extensions to the predefined set of metadata names</a>.</p>
     </li><li data-md="">
      <p>Authors can use the <code><a data-link-type="element-attr" href="semantics.html#element-attrdef-link-rel">rel=""</a></code> mechanism to annotate links with specific meanings by
registering <a data-link-type="dfn" href="semantics.html#link-types-extensions-to-the-predefined-set-of-link-type">extensions to the predefined set of link types</a>. This is also used by
microformats. Additionally, absolute URLs that do not contain any non-ASCII characters, nor
characters in the range U+0041 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A) through U+005A (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z)
(inclusive), may be used as link types.</p>
     </li><li data-md="">
      <p>Authors can embed raw data using the <code>&lt;script type=""&gt;</code> mechanism with a custom
type, for further handling by inline or server-side scripts.</p>
     </li><li data-md="">
      <p>Authors can create <a data-link-type="dfn" href="infrastructure.html#plugin">plugins</a> and invoke them using the <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-embed">embed</a></code> element. This is how
Flash works.</p>
     </li><li data-md="">
      <p>Authors can extend APIs using the JavaScript prototyping mechanism. This is widely used by
script libraries, for instance.</p>
    </li></ul>
    <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="1.6" id="html-vs-xhtml"><span class="secno">1.6. </span><span class="content">HTML vs XHTML</span><a class="self-link" href="introduction.html#html-vs-xhtml"></a></h3>
    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>This specification defines an abstract language for describing documents and applications, and
  some APIs for interacting with in-memory representations of resources that use this language.</p>
    <p>The in-memory representation is known as "DOM HTML", or "the DOM" for short.</p>
    <p>There are various concrete syntaxes that can be used to transmit resources that use this abstract
  language, two of which are defined in this specification.</p>
    <p>The first such concrete syntax is the HTML syntax. This is the format suggested for most authors.
  It is compatible with most legacy Web browsers. If a document is transmitted with the <a href="iana.html#text-html"><code>text/html</code></a> <a data-link-type="dfn" href="infrastructure.html#mime-type">MIME type</a>, then it will be processed as an HTML document by Web
  browsers. This specification defines version 5.1 of the HTML syntax, known as "HTML5.1".</p>
    <p>The second concrete syntax is the XHTML syntax, which is an application of XML. When a document
  is transmitted with an <a data-link-type="dfn" href="infrastructure.html#xml-mime-type">XML MIME type</a>, such as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>,
  then it is treated as an XML document by Web browsers, to be parsed by an XML processor. Authors
  are reminded that the processing for XML and HTML differs; in particular, even minor syntax
  errors will prevent a document labeled as XML from being rendered fully, whereas they would be
  ignored in the HTML syntax. This specification defines version 5.1 of the XHTML syntax,
  known as "XHTML5.1".</p>
    <p>The DOM, the HTML syntax, and the XHTML syntax cannot all represent the same content. For
  example, namespaces cannot be represented using the HTML syntax, but they are supported in the
  DOM and in the XHTML syntax. Similarly, documents that use the <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-noscript">noscript</a></code> feature can
  be represented using the HTML syntax, but cannot be represented with the DOM or in the XHTML
  syntax. Comments that contain the string "<code>--&gt;</code>" can only be represented in the
  DOM, not in the HTML and XHTML syntaxes.</p>

    <p>This specification should be read like all other specifications. First, it should be read
  cover-to-cover, multiple times. Then, it should be read backwards at least once. Then it should be
  read by picking random sections from the contents list and following all the cross-references.</p>
    <p>As described in the conformance requirements section below, this specification describes
  conformance criteria for a variety of conformance classes. In particular, there are conformance
  requirements that apply to <em>producers</em>, for example authors and the documents they create,
  and there are conformance requirements that apply to <em>consumers</em>, for example Web browsers.
  They can be distinguished by what they are requiring: a requirement on a producer states what is
  allowed, while a requirement on a consumer states how software is to act.</p>
    <div class="example" id="example-7e5c439b"><a class="self-link" href="introduction.html#example-7e5c439b"></a> For example, "the <code>foo</code> attribute’s value must be a <a data-link-type="dfn" href="infrastructure.html#valid-integer">valid integer</a>" is a
    requirement on producers, as it lays out the allowed values; in contrast, the requirement "the <code>foo</code> attribute’s value must be parsed using the <a data-link-type="dfn" href="infrastructure.html#integers-parses">rules for parsing integers</a>"
    is a requirement on consumers, as it describes how to process the content. </div>
    <p><strong>Requirements on producers have no bearing whatsoever on consumers.</strong></p>
    <div class="example" id="example-287546e8"><a class="self-link" href="introduction.html#example-287546e8"></a> Continuing the above example, a requirement stating that a particular attribute’s value is
    constrained to being a <a data-link-type="dfn" href="infrastructure.html#valid-integer">valid integer</a> emphatically does <em>not</em> imply anything about
    the requirements on consumers. It might be that the consumers are in fact required to treat the
    attribute as an opaque string, completely unaffected by whether the value conforms to the
    requirements or not. It might be (as in the previous example) that the consumers are required to
    parse the value using specific rules that define how invalid (non-numeric in this case) values
    are to be processed. </div>

    <h3 class="heading settled" data-level="1.8" id="fingerprint"><span class="secno">1.8. </span><span class="content">Privacy concerns</span><a class="self-link" href="introduction.html#fingerprint"></a></h3>
    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>Some features of HTML trade user convenience for a measure of user privacy.</p>
    <p>In general, due to the Internet’s architecture, a user can be distinguished from another by the
  user’s IP address. IP addresses do not perfectly match to a user; as a user moves from device to
  device, or from network to network, their IP address will change; similarly, NAT routing, proxy
  servers, and shared computers enable packets that appear to all come from a single IP address to
  actually map to multiple users. Technologies such as onion routing can be used to further
  anonymize requests so that requests from a single user at one node on the Internet appear to come
  from many disparate parts of the network.</p>
    <p>However, the IP address used for a user’s requests is not the only mechanism by which a user’s
  requests could be related to each other. Cookies, for example, are designed specifically to enable
  this, and are the basis of most of the Web’s session features that enable you to log into a site
  with which you have an account.</p>
    <p>There are other mechanisms that are more subtle. Certain characteristics of a user’s system can be
  used to distinguish groups of users from each other; by collecting enough such information, an
  individual user’s browser’s "digital fingerprint" can be computed, which can be as good, if not
  better, as an IP address in ascertaining which requests are from the same user.</p>
    <p>Grouping requests in this manner, especially across multiple sites, can be used for both benign
  (and even arguably positive) purposes, as well as for malevolent purposes. An example of a
  reasonably benign purpose would be determining whether a particular person seems to prefer sites
  with dog illustrations as opposed to sites with cat illustrations (based on how often they visit
  the sites in question) and then automatically using the preferred illustrations on subsequent
  visits to participating sites. Malevolent purposes, however, could include governments combining
  information such as the person’s home address (determined from the addresses they use when getting
  driving directions on one site) with their apparent political affiliations (determined by
  examining the forum sites that they participate in) to determine whether the person should be
  prevented from voting in an election.</p>
    <p>Since the malevolent purposes can be remarkably evil, user agent implementors are encouraged to
  consider how to provide their users with tools to minimize leaking information that could be used
  to fingerprint a user.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, as the first paragraph in this section implies, sometimes there is great benefit
  to be derived from exposing the very information that can also be used for fingerprinting
  purposes, so it’s not as easy as simply blocking all possible leaks. For instance, the ability to
  log into a site to post under a specific identity requires that the user’s requests be
  identifiable as all being from the same user, more or less by definition. More subtly, though,
  information such as how wide text is, which is necessary for many effects that involve drawing
  text onto a canvas (e.g. any effect that involves drawing a border around the text) also leaks
  information that can be used to group a user’s requests. (In this case, by potentially exposing,
  via a brute force search, which fonts a user has installed, information which can vary
  considerably from user to user.)</p>
    <p>Features in this specification which can be <dfn data-dfn-type="dfn" data-lt="for privacy" data-noexport="" id="fingerprinting-vector">used to fingerprint the user<a class="self-link" href="introduction.html#fingerprinting-vector"></a></dfn> are marked as this paragraph is. <a class="fingerprint" href="introduction.html#fingerprinting-vector"><img alt="(This is a fingerprinting vector.)" height="21" src="images/fingerprint.png" width="15"></a></p>
    <p>Other features in the platform can be used for the same purpose, though, including, though not
  limited to:</p>
    <ul>
     <li data-md="">
      <p>The exact list of which features a user agents supports.</p>
     </li><li data-md="">

     </li><li data-md="">
      <p>Features that describe the user’s environment, like Media Queries and the <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cssom-view/#screen">Screen</a></code> object. <a data-link-type="biblio" href="references.html#biblio-mediaq">[MEDIAQ]</a> <a data-link-type="biblio" href="references.html#biblio-cssom-view">[CSSOM-VIEW]</a></p>

    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>A basic HTML document looks like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight" id="intro-early-example"><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Sample page<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Sample page<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>HTML documents consist of a tree of elements and text. Each element is denoted in the source by
  a <a data-link-type="dfn" href="syntax.html#start-tag">start tag</a>, such as "<code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-body">&lt;body&gt;</a></code>", and an <a data-link-type="dfn" href="syntax.html#end-tag">end tag</a>, such as
  "<code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-body">&lt;/body&gt;</a></code>". (Certain start tags and end tags can in certain cases be <a data-link-type="dfn" href="syntax.html#optional-start-and-end-tags">omitted</a> and are implied by other tags.)</p>
    <p>Tags have to be nested such that elements are all completely within each other, without
  overlapping:</p>
<pre class="bad highlight"><span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>This is <span class="nt">&lt;em&gt;</span>very <span class="nt">&lt;strong&gt;</span>wrong<span class="nt">&lt;/em&gt;</span>!<span class="nt">&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</span></pre>

    <p>This specification defines a set of elements that can be used in HTML, along with rules about the
  ways in which the elements can be nested.</p>
    <p>Elements can have attributes, which control how the elements work. In the example below, there
  is a <a data-link-type="dfn" href="semantics.html#hyperlink">hyperlink</a>, formed using the <code><a data-link-type="element" href="#a">a</a></code> element and its <code><a data-link-type="element-attr" href="semantics.html#element-attrdef-links-href">href</a></code> attribute:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"demo.html"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>simple<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span></pre>
    <p><a data-link-type="dfn" href="syntax.html#attribute">Attributes</a> are placed inside the start tag, and consist of a <a data-link-type="dfn" href="syntax.html#name">name</a> and a <a data-link-type="dfn" href="syntax.html#attribute-value">value</a>, separated by an "<code>=</code>" character. The attribute value can remain <a data-link-type="dfn" href="syntax.html#unquoted">unquoted</a> if it doesn’t contain <a data-link-type="dfn" href="infrastructure.html#space-characters">space characters</a> or any of <code>"</code> <code>'</code> <code>`</code> <code>=</code> <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code>. Otherwise,
  it has to be quoted using either single or double quotes. The value, along with the
  "<code>=</code>" character, can be omitted altogether if the value is the empty string.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><span class="c">&lt;!-- empty attributes --&gt;</span>

    <p>HTML user agents (e.g. Web browsers) then <i>parse</i> this markup, turning it into a DOM
  (Document Object Model) tree. A DOM tree is an in-memory representation of a document.</p>
    <p>DOM trees contain several kinds of nodes, in particular a <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#documenttype">DocumentType</a></code> node, <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#element">Element</a></code> nodes, <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#text">Text</a></code> nodes, <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#comment">Comment</a></code> nodes, and in some
  cases <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#processinginstruction">ProcessingInstruction</a></code> nodes.</p>
    <p>The <a href="introduction.html#intro-early-example">markup snippet at the top of this section</a> would be turned into the following DOM tree:</p>

    <p>The <a data-link-type="dfn" href="infrastructure.html#root-element">root element</a> of this tree is the <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-html">html</a></code> element, which is the element always found at
  the root of HTML documents. It contains two elements, <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-head">head</a></code> and <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-body">body</a></code>, as well as a <code class="idl"><a class="idl-code" data-link-type="interface" href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#text">Text</a></code> node between them.</p>
    <p>There are many more <code class="idl"><a class="idl-code" data-link-type="interface" href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#text">Text</a></code> nodes in the DOM tree than one would initially expect,
  because the source contains a number of spaces (represented here by "␣") and line breaks
  ("⏎") that all end up as <code class="idl"><a class="idl-code" data-link-type="interface" href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#text">Text</a></code> nodes in the DOM. However, for historical
  reasons not all of the spaces and line breaks in the original markup appear in the DOM. In
  particular, all the whitespace before <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-head">head</a></code> start tag ends up being dropped silently, and all
  the whitespace after the <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-body">body</a></code> end tag ends up placed at the end of the <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-body">body</a></code>.</p>
    <p>The <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-head">head</a></code> element contains a <a data-link-type="element" href="#title"><code>title</code></a> element, which itself contains a <code class="idl"><a class="idl-code" data-link-type="interface" href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#text">Text</a></code> node
  with the text "Sample page". Similarly, the <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-body">body</a></code> element contains an <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-h1">h1</a></code> element, a <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-p">p</a></code> element, and a comment.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>This DOM tree can be manipulated from scripts in the page. Scripts (typically in JavaScript)
  are small programs that can be embedded using the <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-script">script</a></code> element or using <a data-link-type="dfn" href="webappapis.html#event-handler-content-event-handler-content-attribute">event handler content attributes</a>. For example, here is a form with a script that sets the
  value of the form’s <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-output">output</a></code> element to say "Hello World"</p>
<pre class="highlight"><span class="nt">&lt;form</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"main"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  Result: <span class="nt">&lt;output</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"result"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/output&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span>
    <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">forms</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">main</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">elements</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'Hello World'</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/form&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>Each element in the DOM tree is represented by an object, and these objects have APIs so that
  they can be manipulated. For instance, a link (e.g. the <code><a data-link-type="element" href="#a">a</a></code> element in the tree above) can have
  its "<code><a data-link-type="element-attr" href="semantics.html#element-attrdef-links-href">href</a></code>" attribute changed in several ways:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">links</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">];</span> <span class="c1">// obtain the first link in the document</span>
<span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">href</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'sample.html'</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// change the destination URL of the link</span>
<span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">protocol</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'https'</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// change just the scheme part of the URL</span>

    <p>Since DOM trees are used as the way to represent HTML documents when they are processed and
  presented by implementations (especially interactive implementations like Web browsers), this
  specification is mostly phrased in terms of DOM trees, instead of the markup described above.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>HTML documents represent a media-independent description of interactive content. HTML documents
  might be rendered to a screen, or through a speech synthesizer, or on a braille display. To
  influence exactly how such rendering takes place, authors can use a styling language such as CSS.</p>
    <p>In the following example, the page has been made yellow-on-blue using CSS.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Sample styled page<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;style&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">body</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">background</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nb">navy</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nb">yellow</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/style&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Sample styled page<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>This page is just a demo.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span></pre>
    <p>For more details on how to use HTML, authors are encouraged to consult tutorials and guides. Some
  of the examples included in this specification might also be of use, but the novice author is
  cautioned that this specification, by necessity, defines the language with a level of detail that
  might be difficult to understand at first.</p>

    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>When HTML is used to create interactive sites, care needs to be taken to avoid introducing
  vulnerabilities through which attackers can compromise the integrity of the site itself or of
  the site’s users.</p>
    <p>A comprehensive study of this matter is beyond the scope of this document, and authors are
  strongly encouraged to study the matter in more detail. However, this section attempts to provide
  a quick introduction to some common pitfalls in HTML application development.</p>
    <p>The security model of the Web is based on the concept of "origins", and correspondingly many of
  the potential attacks on the Web involve cross-origin actions. <a data-link-type="biblio" href="references.html#biblio-origin">[ORIGIN]</a></p>
    <dl>
     <dt data-md="">
      <p>Not validating user input</p>
     </dt><dt data-md="">
      <p>Cross-site scripting (XSS)</p>
     </dt><dt data-md="">
      <p>SQL injection</p>
     </dt><dd data-md="">
      <p>When accepting untrusted input, e.g. user-generated content such as text comments, values
  in URL parameters, messages from third-party sites, etc, it is imperative that the data
  be validated before use, and properly escaped when displayed. Failing to do this can
  allow a hostile user to perform a variety of attacks, ranging from the potentially
  benign, such as providing bogus user information like a negative age, to the serious,
  such as running scripts every time a user looks at a page that includes the information,
  potentially propagating the attack in the process, to the catastrophic, such as deleting
  all data in the server.</p>
      <p>When writing filters to validate user input, it is imperative that filters always be
  safelist-based, allowing known-safe constructs and disallowing all other input.
  Blocklist-based filters that disallow known-bad inputs and allow everything else are not
  secure, as not everything that is bad is yet known (for example, because it might be invented
  in the future).</p>
      <div class="example" id="example-fd8071c5">
       <a class="self-link" href="introduction.html#example-fd8071c5"></a> For example, suppose a page looked at its URL’s query string to determine what to display,
    and the site then redirected the user to that page to display a message, as in: 
<pre class="highlight"><span class="nt">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"message.cgi?say=Hello"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Say Hello<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"message.cgi?say=Welcome"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Say Welcome<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"message.cgi?say=Kittens"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Say Kittens<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/ul&gt;</span></pre>
       <p>If the message was just displayed to the user without escaping, a hostile attacker could
    then craft a URL that contained a script element:</p>
<pre>http://example.com/message.cgi?say=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27Oh%20no%21%27%29%3C/script%3E</pre>
       <p>If the attacker then convinced a victim user to visit this page, a script of the
    attacker’s choosing would run on the page. Such a script could do any number of hostile
    actions, limited only by what the site offers: if the site is an e-commerce shop, for
    instance, such a script could cause the user to unknowingly make arbitrarily many
    unwanted purchases.</p>
       <p>This is called a cross-site scripting attack.</p>
      </div>
      <p>There are many constructs that can be used to try to trick a site into executing code. Here
  are some that authors are encouraged to consider when writing safelist filters:</p>
      <ul>
       <li data-md="">
        <p>When allowing harmless-seeming elements like <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-img">img</a></code>, it is important to safelist any
provided attributes as well. If one allowed all attributes then an attacker could, for
instance, use the <a class="idl-code" data-link-type="attribute" href="webappapis.html#dom-globaleventhandlers-onload"><code>onload</code></a> attribute to run arbitrary script.</p>
       </li><li data-md="">
        <p>When allowing URLs to be provided (e.g. for links), the scheme of each URL also needs to be
explicitly safelisted, as there are many schemes that can be abused. The most prominent
example is "<code>javascript:</code>", but user agents can implement (and indeed, have
historically implemented) others.</p>
       </li><li data-md="">
        <p>Allowing a <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-base">base</a></code> element to be inserted means any <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-script">script</a></code> elements in the page with
relative links can be hijacked, and similarly that any form submissions can get redirected
to a hostile site.</p>
      </li></ul>
      <dl>
       <dt data-md="">
        <p>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)</p>
       </dt><dd data-md="">
        <p>If a site allows a user to make form submissions with user-specific side-effects, for example
posting messages on a forum under the user’s name, making purchases, or applying for a
passport, it is important to verify that the request was made by the user intentionally,
rather than by another site tricking the user into making the request unknowingly.</p>
        <p>This problem exists because HTML forms can be submitted to other origins.</p>
        <p>Sites can prevent such attacks by populating forms with user-specific hidden tokens, or by
checking <code>Origin</code> headers on all requests.</p>
       </dd><dt data-md="">
        <p>Clickjacking</p>
       </dt><dd data-md="">
        <p>A page that provides users with an interface to perform actions that the user might not
wish to perform needs to be designed so as to avoid the possibility that users can be
tricked into activating the interface.</p>
        <p>One way that a user could be so tricked is if a hostile site places the victim site in a
small <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-iframe">iframe</a></code> and then convinces the user to click, for instance by having the user play
a reaction game. Once the user is playing the game, the hostile site can quickly position
the <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-iframe">iframe</a></code> under the mouse cursor just as the user is about to click, thus tricking the
user into clicking the victim site’s interface.</p>
        <p>To avoid this, sites that do not expect to be used in frames are encouraged to only enable
their interface if they detect that they are not in a frame (e.g. by comparing the <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="browsers.html#dom-window-window">window</a></code> object to the value of the <code class="idl"><a data-link-type="idl" href="browsers.html#dom-window-top">top</a></code> attribute).</p>

    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>Scripts in HTML have "run-to-completion" semantics, meaning that the browser will generally run
  the script uninterrupted before doing anything else, such as firing further events or continuing
  to parse the document.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, parsing of HTML files happens <a data-link-type="dfn" href="infrastructure.html#in-parallel">in parallel</a> and incrementally, meaning
  that the parser can pause at any point to let scripts run. This is generally a good thing, but it
  does mean that authors need to be careful to avoid hooking event handlers after the events could
  have possibly fired.</p>
    <p>There are two techniques for doing this reliably: use <a data-link-type="dfn" href="webappapis.html#event-handler-content-event-handler-content-attribute">event handler content attributes</a>, or
  create the element and add the event handlers in the same script. The latter is safe because, as
  mentioned earlier, scripts are run to completion before further events can fire.</p>
    <div class="example" id="example-c289d2c4">
     <a class="self-link" href="introduction.html#example-c289d2c4"></a> One way this could manifest itself is with <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-img">img</a></code> elements and the <code>load</code> event.
    The event could fire as soon as the element has been parsed, especially if the image has already
    been cached (which is common). 
     <p>Here, the author uses the <a class="idl-code" data-link-type="attribute" href="webappapis.html#dom-globaleventhandlers-onload"><code>onload</code></a> handler on an <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-img">img</a></code> element to catch the <code>load</code> event:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"games.png"</span> <span class="na">alt=</span><span class="s">"Games"</span> <span class="na">onload=</span><span class="s">"gamesLogoHasLoaded(event)"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span></pre>
     <p>If the element is being added by script, then so long as the event handlers are added in the
    same script, the event will still not be missed:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">img</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Image</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nx">img</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">src</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'games.png'</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nx">img</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">alt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'Games'</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nx">img</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">onload</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">gamesLogoHasLoaded</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">// img.addEventListener('load', gamesLogoHasLoaded, false); // would work also</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span></pre>
     <p>However, if the author first created the <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-img">img</a></code> element and then in a separate
    script added the event listeners, there’s a chance that the <code>load</code> event would be
    fired in between, leading it to be missed:</p>
<pre class="bad highlight"><span class="c">&lt;!-- Do not use this style, it has a race condition! --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"games"</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"games.png"</span> <span class="na">alt=</span><span class="s">"Games"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="c">&lt;!-- the 'load' event might fire here while the parser is taking a</span>
<span class="c">    break, in which case you will not see it! --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">img</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementById</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'games'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">img</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">onload</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">gamesLogoHasLoaded</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// might never fire!</span>

    <p>Authors are encouraged to make use of conformance checkers (also known as <i>validators</i>) to
  catch common mistakes. The W3C provides a number of online validation services, including the <a data-link-type="dfn" external="" href="http://validator.w3.org/nu/#">Nu Markup Validation Service</a>.</p>

    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>Unlike previous versions of the HTML specification, this specification defines in some detail the
  required processing for invalid documents as well as valid documents.</p>
    <p>However, even though the processing of invalid content is in most cases well-defined, conformance
  requirements for documents are still important: in practice, interoperability (the situation in
  which all implementations process particular content in a reliable and identical or equivalent
  way) is not the only goal of document conformance requirements. This section details some of the
  more common reasons for still distinguishing between a <a data-link-type="dfn" href="infrastructure.html#conforming-document">conforming document</a> and one with errors.</p>
    <h4 class="heading settled" data-level="1.10.1" id="presentational-markup"><span class="secno">1.10.1. </span><span class="content">Presentational markup</span><a class="self-link" href="introduction.html#presentational-markup"></a></h4>
    <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
    <p>The majority of presentational features from previous versions of HTML are no longer allowed.
  Presentational markup in general has been found to have a number of problems:</p>
    <dl>
     <dt data-md="">
      <p>The use of presentational elements leads to poorer accessibility</p>
     </dt><dd data-md="">
      <p>While it is possible to use presentational markup in a way that provides users of assistive
  technologies (ATs) with an acceptable experience (e.g. using ARIA), doing so is significantly
  more difficult than doing so when using semantically-appropriate markup. Furthermore, even
  using such techniques doesn’t help make pages accessible for non-AT non-graphical users, such
  as users of text-mode browsers.</p>
      <p>Using media-independent markup, on the other hand, provides an easy way for documents to be
  authored in such a way that they work for more users (e.g. text browsers).</p>
     </dd><dt data-md="">
      <p>Higher cost of maintenance</p>
     </dt><dd data-md="">
      <p>It is significantly easier to maintain a site written in such a way that the markup is
  style-independent. For example, changing the color of a site that uses <code>&lt;font&nbsp;color=""&gt;</code> throughout requires changes across the entire site,
  whereas a similar change to a site based on CSS can be done by changing a single file.</p>
     </dd><dt data-md="">
      <p>Larger document sizes</p>
     </dt><dd data-md="">
      <p>Presentational markup tends to be much more redundant, and thus results in larger document
  sizes.</p>
      <p>For those reasons, presentational markup has been removed from HTML in this version. This
  change should not come as a surprise; HTML4 deprecated presentational markup many years ago
  and provided a mode (HTML4 Transitional) to help authors move away from presentational markup;
  later, XHTML 1.1 went further and obsoleted those features altogether.</p>
      <p>The only remaining presentational markup features in HTML are the <code><a data-link-type="element-attr" href="dom.html#element-attrdef-global-style">style</a></code> attribute
  and the <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-style">style</a></code> element. Use of the <code><a data-link-type="element-attr" href="dom.html#element-attrdef-global-style">style</a></code> attribute is somewhat discouraged in
  production environments, but it can be useful for rapid prototyping (where its rules can be
  directly moved into a separate style sheet later) and for providing specific styles in unusual
  cases where a separate style sheet would be inconvenient. Similarly, the <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-style">style</a></code> element can
  be useful in syndication or for page-specific styles, but in general an external style sheet
  is likely to be more convenient when the styles apply to multiple pages.</p>
      <p>It is also worth noting that some elements that were previously presentational have been
  redefined in this specification to be media-independent: <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-b">b</a></code>, <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-i">i</a></code>, <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-hr">hr</a></code>, <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-s">s</a></code>, <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-small">small</a></code>, and <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-u">u</a></code>.</p>

      <p>Errors involving fragile syntax constructs</p>
     </dt><dd data-md="">
      <p>There are syntax constructs that, for historical reasons, are relatively fragile. To help
  reduce the number of users who accidentally run into such problems, they are made
  non-conforming.</p>
      <div class="example" id="example-4c330288">
       <a class="self-link" href="introduction.html#example-4c330288"></a> For example, the parsing of certain named character references in attributes happens even
    with the closing semicolon being omitted. It is safe to include an ampersand followed by
    letters that do not form a named character reference, but if the letters are changed to a
    string that <em>does</em> form a named character reference, they will be interpreted as that
    character instead. 
       <p>In this fragment, the attribute’s value is "<code>?bill&amp;ted</code>":</p>
<pre class="bad highlight"><span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"?bill&amp;ted"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Bill and Ted<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span></pre>
       <p>In the following fragment, however, the attribute’s value is actually
      "<code>?art©</code>", <em>not</em> the intended "<code>?art&amp;copy</code>",
      because even without the final semicolon, "<code>&amp;copy</code>" is handled the same
      as "<code>&amp;copy;</code>" and thus gets interpreted as "<code>©</code>":</p>
<pre class="bad highlight"><span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"?art&amp;copy"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Art and Copy<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span></pre>
       <p>To avoid this problem, all named character references are required to end with a
      semicolon, and uses of named character references without a semicolon are flagged as
      errors.</p>
       <p>Thus, the correct way to express the above cases is as follows:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"?bill&amp;ted"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Bill and Ted<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> <span class="c">&lt;!-- &amp;ted is ok, since it’s not a named character reference --&gt;</span></pre>

       <a class="self-link" href="introduction.html#example-1ef96626"></a> For example, it is unclear whether the author intended the following to be an <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-h1">h1</a></code> heading

  save the author a lot of debugging time. This specification therefore usually considers it
  an error to use element names, attribute names, and so forth, that do not match the names
  defined in this specification.</p>
      <p class="example" id="example-3eebe0bd"><a class="self-link" href="introduction.html#example-3eebe0bd"></a> For example, if the author typed <code>&lt;capton&gt;</code> instead of <code><a data-link-type="element" href="semantics.html#elementdef-caption">&lt;caption&gt;</a></code>, this would be flagged as an error and the author could correct

    </dd></dl>
    <p>Some authors find it helpful to be in the practice of always quoting all attributes and always
  including all optional tags, preferring the consistency derived from such custom over the minor
  benefits of terseness afforded by making use of the flexibility of the HTML syntax. To aid such
  authors, conformance checkers can provide modes of operation wherein such conventions are
  enforced.</p>

    executable script — which can lead to authors spending a lot of time trying to debug
    the inline script without realizing that it is not executing. To reduce this problem, this

      <blockquote> This Architectural Specification provides authors of specifications, software developers,
    and content developers with a common reference for interoperable text manipulation on the
    World Wide Web, building on the Universal Character Set, defined jointly by the Unicode
    Standard and ISO/IEC 10646. Topics addressed include use of the terms "character",
    "encoding" and "string", a reference processing model, choice and identification of
    character encodings, character escaping, and string indexing. </blockquote>

     </dt><dd data-md="">
      <blockquote> Because Unicode contains such a large number of characters and incorporates the varied
    writing systems of the world, incorrect usage can expose programs or systems to possible
    security attacks. This is especially important as more and more products are
    internationalized. This document describes some of the security considerations that
    programmers, system analysts, standards developers, and users should take into account, and
    provides specific recommendations to reduce the risk of problems. </blockquote>

     </dt><dd data-md="">
      <blockquote> Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 covers a wide range of recommendations for
    making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content accessible
    to a wider range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness
    and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech
    disabilities, photosensitivity and combinations of these. Following these guidelines will
    also often make your Web content more usable to users in general. </blockquote>

     </dt><dd data-md="">
      <blockquote> This specification provides guidelines for designing Web content authoring tools that are
    more accessible for people with disabilities. An authoring tool that conforms to these
    guidelines will promote accessibility by providing an accessible user interface to authors
    with disabilities as well as by enabling, supporting, and promoting the production of
    accessible Web content by all authors. </blockquote>

      <blockquote> This document provides guidelines for designing user agents that lower barriers to Web
    accessibility for people with disabilities. User agents include browsers and other types of
    software that retrieve and render Web content. A user agent that conforms to these
    guidelines will promote accessibility through its own user interface and through other
    internal facilities, including its ability to communicate with other technologies
    (especially assistive technologies). Furthermore, all users, not just users with
    disabilities, should find conforming user agents to be more usable. </blockquote>

      <blockquote> A document that uses polyglot markup is a document that is a stream of bytes that parses
    into identical document trees (with the exception of the xmlns attribute on the root
    element) when processed as HTML and when processed as XML. Polyglot markup that meets a
    well defined set of constraints is interpreted as compatible, regardless of whether they are
    processed as HTML or as XHTML, per the HTML5 specification. Polyglot markup uses a specific
    DOCTYPE, namespace declarations, and a specific case — normally lower case but
    occasionally camel case — for element and attribute names. Polyglot markup uses lower
    case for certain attribute values. Further constraints include those on empty elements,
    named entity references, and the use of scripts and style. </blockquote>
