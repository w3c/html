# Web Platform Working Group

Contributions to this repository are intended to become part of the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) [HTML Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/tr/html/), and are governed by the [W3C Patent Policy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and [Software and Document License](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software).

## Contributing

Before making your first contribution, you should read the documentation on [editing conventions and the source documents](https://github.com/w3c/html/blob/master/docs/contributing-documentation.md). You may also want to read [how the spec is built](https://github.com/w3c/html/blob/master/docs/build-documentation.md).

Editorial improvements are welcome, just make a [Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/w3c/html/pulls)! You may encounter a warning about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) commitments if you are not a member of the W3C [Web Platform Working Group (WebPlat WG)](https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/), but this will be handled by the WebPlat WG editorial team. Specific concerns about IPR and the W3C may be found in the [Intellectual Rights FAQ](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620.html).

Your concern might already be known. Before beginning work, check [the issue tracker](https://github.com/w3c/html/issues) to see if there are any existing discussions about the issue. If you want to help but are unsure how to begin, some issues are marked as [good first issues](https://github.com/w3c/html/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or [help wanted](https://github.com/w3c/html/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). These might be good places to start. 

Proposals for new elements are best discussed on the [WICG Discourse](https://discourse.wicg.io/).

To make **substantive** contributions, changes that clarify or update conformance requirements, you must either participate in the W3C [Web Platform Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/) or make a [non-member patent licensing commitment](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/83482/nmlc). 
This is because the W3C Patent Policy depends on granting licenses for the [essential claims](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#def-essential) needed to implement the spec. A list of [previous substantive contributions](https://github.com/w3c/html/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed+label%3Asubstantive) can be found on the issue tracker.

If your contribution includes the work of others, please see [Contributing Documentation](https://github.com/w3c/html/blob/master/docs/contributing-documentation.md for further guidance).

## Tests

For **substantive changes**, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) PR is highly appreciated. The W3C defines a normative change as edits that affect the formal part of the Recommendation, rules that everyone must follow. **Non-substantive** changes affect supplementary information and guidance for these rules.

Typically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/new) to follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.

## Language and Terminology

It may help to familiarize yourself with the specific language used by the W3C HTML Recommendation. A [full Index of terms](https://w3c.github.io/html/fullindex.html#index) used by the specification is available, as well as a [Manual of Style](https://w3c.github.io/manual-of-style/).
