handled by the editorial team.

Some issues are marked as [good first issues](https://github.com/w3c/html/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
or [help wanted](https://github.com/w3c/html/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
If you want to help but are unsure how to begin, these might be good places to start. 

You should read the documentation on 
[editing conventions and the source documents](https://github.com/w3c/html/blob/master/docs/contributing-documentation.md), 
and you may want to read [how the spec is built](https://github.com/w3c/html/blob/master/docs/build-documentation.md)
  
To make **substantive contributions** that clarify or change conformance requirements, you must either participate
in the W3C [Web Platform Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/)
or make a	[non-member patent licensing commitment](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/83482/nmlc).

# Tests

For normative changes, a corresponding
[web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) PR is highly appreciated. Typically,
both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should
not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why
and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/new) to follow
up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.
