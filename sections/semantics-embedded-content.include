  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  To embed an image in HTML, when there is only a single image resource,
  use the <{img}> element and with its <{img/src}> and <{img/alt}> attributes.

  <div class="example">
    <xmp highlight="html">
      <h2>From today's featured article</h2>
      <img src="/uploads/100-marie-lloyd.jpg" alt="A singer on the stage" width="100" height="150">
      <p><a href="/wiki/Marie_Lloyd">Marie Lloyd</a> (1870–1922)
      was an English <a href="/wiki/Music_hall">music hall</a> singer, ...

  </div>

  However, there are a number of situations for which the author might wish to use multiple image
  resources that the user agent can choose from:

  <ul>

    <li>

    Different users might have different environmental characteristics:

    <ul>

      <li>

      The users' physical screen size might be different from one another.

      <div class="example">
        A mobile phone's screen might be 4 inches diagonally, while a laptop's screen might be 14
        inches diagonally.

        <img alt="The phone's screen is much smaller compared to the laptop's screen." src="images/twodevices.svg" />


      </div>

      <p class="note">
        This is only relevant when an image's rendered size depends on the <a>viewport</a> size.
      </p>

      </li>

      <li>

      The users' screen pixel density might be different from one another.

      <div class="example">
        A mobile phone's screen might have three times as many physical pixels per inch compared to
        another mobile phone's screen, regardless of their physical screen size.

        <img alt="One phone has big pixels, the other has small pixels." src="images/magnify-pixels.svg" />
      </div>

      </li>

      <li>

      The users' zoom level might be different from one another, or might change for a single user
      over time.

      <p class="example">
        A user might zoom in to a particular image to be able to get a more detailed look.
      </p>

      The zoom level and the screen pixel density (the previous point) can both affect the
      number of physical screen pixels per CSS pixel. This ratio is usually referred to as
      <dfn>device-pixel-ratio</dfn>.

      </li>

      <li>

        The users' screen orientation might be different from one another, or might change for a
        single user over time.

      <div class="example">
        A tablet can be held upright or rotated 90 degrees, so that the screen is either "portrait"
        or "landscape".

        <img alt="The tablet has two orientations." src="images/orientations.svg" />
      </div>

      </li>

      <li>

      The users' network speed, network latency and bandwidth cost might be different from one
      another, or might change for a single user over time.

      <p class="example">
        A user might be on a fast, low-latency and constant-cost connection while at work, on a
        slow, low-latency and constant-cost connection while at home, and on a variable-speed,
        high-latency and variable-cost connection anywhere else.
      </p>

      </li>

    </ul>

    </li>

    <li>

    Authors might want to show the same image content but with different rendered size depending
    on, usually, the width of the <a>viewport</a>. This is usually referred to as
    <dfn><a>viewport</a>-based selection</dfn>.

    <div class="example">
      A Web page might have a banner at the top that always spans the entire <a>viewport</a>
      width. In this case, the rendered size of the image depends on the physical size of the screen
      (assuming a maximised browser window).

      <img alt="The upright-held phone shows a small wolf at the top, and the tablet shows the same image but it is bigger" src="images/viewport-based.svg" />
    </div>

    <div class="example">
     Another Web page might have images in columns, with a single column for screens with a small
     physical size, two columns for screens with medium physical size, and three columns for screens
     with big physical size, with the images varying in rendered size in each case to fill up the
     <a>viewport</a>. In this case, the rendered size of an image might be <em>bigger</em> in
     the one-column layout compared to the two-column layout, despite the screen being smaller.

      <img alt="The rotated phone shows a top part of an image of a kettlebell swing; the upright-held tablet shows a bit smaller images in two columns; the laptop shows images in three columns." src="images/flexible-layout.svg" />
    </div>

    </li>

    <li>

    Authors might want to show different image content depending on the rendered size of the image.
    This is usually referred to as <dfn for="image" lt="art directed|art direction">art direction</dfn>.

    <div class="example">
     When a Web page is viewed on a screen with a large physical size (assuming a maximised
     browser window), the author might wish to include some less relevant parts surrounding the
     critical part of the image. When the same Web page is viewed on a screen with a small physical
     size, the author might wish to show only the critical part of the image.

      <img alt="The upright-held phone shows a cropped image of a wolf; the rotated tablet shows the uncropped image." src="images/device-crop.svg" />
    </div>

    </li>

    <li>

    Authors might want to show the same image content but using different image formats, depending
    on which image formats the user agent supports. This is usually referred to as
    <dfn>image format-based selection</dfn>.

    <p class="example">
      A Web page might have some images in the JPEG, WebP and JPEG XR image formats, as the
      latter two have better compression abilities compared to JPEG. Since different user agents
      can support different image formats, with some formats offering better compression ratios,
      the author would like to serve the better formats to user agents that support them, while
      providing a JPEG fallback for user agents that don't.
    </p>

    </li>

  </ul>

  The above situations are not mutually exclusive. For example, it is reasonable to combine
  different resources for different <a>device-pixel-ratio</a> with different resources for
  <a for="image">art direction</a>.

  While it is possible to solve these problems using scripting, doing so introduces some other
  problems:

  <ul>

    <li>Some user agents aggressively download images specified in the HTML markup, before scripts
    have had a chance to run, so that Web pages complete loading sooner. If a script changes which
    image to download, the user agent will potentially start two separate downloads, which can
    instead cause worse page loading performance.</li>

    <li>If the author avoids specifying any image in the HTML markup and instead instantiates a
    single download from script, that avoids the double download problem above but instead it makes
    no image be downloaded at all for users with scripting disabled and it disables the aggressive
    image downloading optimization.</li>

  </ul>

  With this in mind, this specification introduces a number of features to address the above
  problems in a declarative manner.

  <dl>

    <dt><a>Device-pixel-ratio</a>-based selection when the rendered size of the image is fixed</dt>

    <dd>

    The <{img/src}> and <{img/srcset}> attributes on the <{img}> element can be used, using the
    <code>x</code> descriptor, to provide multiple images that only vary in their size (the smaller
    image is a scaled-down version of the bigger image).

    <p class="note">
      The <code>x</code> descriptor is not appropriate when the rendered size of the image depends
      on the <a>viewport</a> width (<a>viewport-based selection</a>), but can be used together
      with <a for="image">art direction</a>.
    </p>

    <div class="example">
      <xmp highlight="html">
        <h2>From today's featured article</h2>
        <img src="/uploads/100-marie-lloyd.jpg"
            srcset="/uploads/150-marie-lloyd.jpg 1.5x, /uploads/200-marie-lloyd.jpg 2x"
            alt="A singer on the stage" width="100" height="150">
        <p>
          <a href="/wiki/Marie_Lloyd">Marie Lloyd</a> (1870–1922)
          was an English <a href="/wiki/Music_hall">music hall</a> singer, ...
      </xmp>

      The user agent can choose any of the given resources depending on the user's screen's pixel
      density, zoom level, and possibly other factors such as the user's network conditions.

      To provide backwards compatibility with older user agents that don't understand the
      <{img/srcset}> attribute, one of the URLs is specified in the <{img}> element's
      <code>src</code> attribute. This will result in something useful (though perhaps at a
      lower-resolution than the user might expect) being displayed even in older user agents.
      For user agents that understand <{img/srcset}>, the <code>src</code> attribute participates
      in the resource selection, as if it had been specified by <{img/srcset}> with a
      <code>1x</code> descriptor.

      The image's rendered size is given in the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>
      attributes, which allows the user agent to allocate space for the image before it is
      downloaded.
    </div>

    </dd>

    <dt><a>Viewport-based selection</a></dt>

    <dd>

    The <{img/srcset}> and <code>sizes</code> attributes can be used,
    using the <code>w</code> descriptor,
    to provide multiple images that only vary in their size
    (the smaller image is a scaled-down version of the bigger image).

    <div class="example">
      In this example, a banner image takes up the entire <a>viewport</a> width
      (using appropriate CSS).

      <xmp highlight="html">
        <h1>
          <img srcset="wolf-400.jpg 400w, wolf-800.jpg 800w, wolf-1600.jpg 1600w"
            src="wolf-400.jpg" sizes="100vw" alt="The rad wolf">
        </h1>
      </xmp>

      The user agent will calculate the effective pixel density of each image from the specified
      <code>w</code> descriptors and the specified rendered size in the <code>sizes</code>
      attribute.
      It can then choose any of the given resources depending on the user's screen's pixel
      density, zoom level, and possibly other factors such as the user's network conditions.

      If the user's screen is 320 CSS pixels wide, this is equivalent to specifying
      <code>wolf-400.jpg 1.25x, wolf-800.jpg 2.5x, wolf-1600.jpg 5x</code>.
      On the other hand, if the user's screen is 1200 CSS pixels wide,
      this is equivalent to specifying
      <code>wolf-400.jpg 0.33x, wolf-800.jpg 0.67x, wolf-1600.jpg 1.33x</code>.
      By using the <code>w</code> descriptors and the <code>sizes</code> attribute,
      the user agent can choose the correct image source to download regardless of how large the user's device is.

      For backwards compatibility,
      one of the URLs is specified in the <{img}> element's <code>src</code> attribute.
      In new user agents, the <code>src</code> attribute is ignored
      when the <{img/srcset}> attribute uses <code>w</code> descriptors.

      In this example, the <code>sizes</code> attribute could be omitted
      because the default value is <code>100vw</code>.

    </div>

    <div class="example">
      In this example, the Web page has three layouts depending on the width of the <a>viewport</a>.
      The narrow layout has one column of images (the width of each image is about 100%),
      the middle layout has two columns of images (the width of each image is about 50%),
      and the widest layout has three columns of images, and some page margin (the width of each image is about 33%).
      It breaks between these layouts when the <a>viewport</a> is <code>30em</code> wide and <code>50em</code> wide, respectively.

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <img sizes="(max-width: 30em) 100vw, (max-width: 50em) 50vw, calc(33vw - 100px)"
      srcset="swing-200.jpg 200w, swing-400.jpg 400w, swing-800.jpg 800w, swing-1600.jpg 1600w"
      src="swing-400.jpg" alt="Kettlebell Swing">
    </xmp>

      The <code>sizes</code> attribute sets up the
      layout breakpoints at <code>30em</code> and <code>50em</code>,
      and declares the image sizes between these breakpoints to be
      <code>100vw</code>, <code>50vw</code>, or <code>calc(33vw - 100px)</code>.
      These sizes do not necessarily have to match up exactly with the actual image width as specified in the CSS.

      The user agent will pick a width from the <code>sizes</code> attribute,
      using the first item with a <<media-condition>> (the part in parentheses) that evaluates to true,
      or using the last item (<code>calc(33vw - 100px)</code>) if they all evaluate to false.

      For example, if the <a>viewport</a> width is <code>29em</code>,
      then <code>(max-width: 30em)</code> evaluates to true and <code>100vw</code> is used,
      so the image size, for the purpose of resource selection, is <code>29em</code>.
      If the <a>viewport</a> width is instead <code>32em</code>,
      then <code>(max-width: 30em)</code> evaluates to false,
      but <code>(max-width: 50em)</code> evaluates to true and <code>50vw</code> is used,
      so the image size, for the purpose of resource selection, is <code>16em</code> (half the <a>viewport</a> width).
      Notice that the slightly wider <a>viewport</a> results in a smaller image because of the different layout.

      The user agent can then calculate the effective pixel density and choose an appropriate
      resource similarly to the previous example.

    </div>

    </dd>

    <dt><a for="image">Art direction</a>-based selection</dt>

    <dd>

    The <{picture}> element and the <{source}> element,
    together with the <code>media</code> attribute,
    can be used, to provide multiple images that vary the image content
    (for instance the smaller image might be a cropped version of the bigger image).

    <div class="example">
      <xmp highlight="html">
        <picture>
          <source media="(min-width: 45em)" srcset="large.jpg">
          <source media="(min-width: 32em)" srcset="med.jpg">
          <img src="small.jpg" alt="The wolf runs through the snow.">
        </picture>
      </xmp>

      The user agent will choose the first <{source}> element
      for which the media query in the <code>media</code> attribute matches,
      and then choose an appropriate URL from its <code>srcset</code> attribute.

      The rendered size of the image varies depending on which resource is chosen.
      To specify dimensions that the user agent can use before having downloaded the image,
      CSS can be used.

      <pre highlight="css">
        img { width: 300px; height: 300px }
        @media (min-width: 32em) { img { width: 500px; height:300px } }
        @media (min-width: 45em) { img { width: 700px; height:400px } }
      </pre>

    </div>

    <div class="example">
      This example combines <a for="image">art direction</a>- and <a>device-pixel-ratio</a>-based selection.
      A banner that takes half the <a>viewport</a> is provided in two versions,
      one for wide screens and one for narrow screens.

      <xmp highlight="html">
        <h1>
          <picture>
            <source media="(max-width: 500px)" srcset="banner-phone.jpeg, banner-phone-HD.jpeg 2x">
            <img src="banner.jpeg" srcset="banner-HD.jpeg 2x" alt="The Breakfast Combo">
          </picture>
        </h1>
      </xmp>

    </div>

    </dd>

    <dt><a>Image format-based selection</a></dt>

    <dd>

    The <code>type</code> attribute on the <{source}> element can be used, to provide multiple
    images in different formats.

    <div class="example">
      <xmp highlight="html">
        <h2>From today's featured article</h2>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="/uploads/100-marie-lloyd.webp" type="image/webp">

      </xmp>

      In this example, the user agent will choose the first <{source}> that has a <{source/type}>
      attribute with a supported MIME type. If the user agent supports WebP images, the first
      <{source}> element will be chosen. If not, but the user agent does support JPEG XR images, the
      second <{source}> element will be chosen. If neither of those formats are supported, the <{img}> element will be chosen.

  The <{picture}> element is a container which provides multiples sources to its contained
  <{img}> element to allow authors to declaratively control or give hints to the user agent about
  which image resource to use, based on the screen pixel density, <a>viewport</a> size, image
  format, and other factors. It <a>represents</a> its children.

  The user agent first tries to match an image source contained within the <{source}> attribute and use that,
  but if none is found, it falls back to what is contained within the <{img}> element, which must be present.

  <div class="example">
    The following example utilizes <a for="image">art direction</a> to provide the appropriate
    image at a particular <a>viewport</a> for small and large screens.

      <xmp highlight="html">

      <a>image candidate string</a>, if there is one, must begin with one or more
      [=space characters=].

      If the <{source/srcset}> attribute has any <a>image candidate strings</a> using a
      <a>width descriptor</a>, the <dfn element-attr for="source"><code>sizes</code></dfn> content
      attribute must also be present, and the value must be a <a>valid source size list</a>.

      The <dfn element-attr for="source"><code>media</code></dfn> content attribute may also be
      present. If present, the value must contain a <a>valid media query list</a>.

      The <{source/type}> gives the type of the images in the <a>source set</a>, to allow the user
      agent to skip to the next <{source}> element if it does not support the given type.

      <p class="note">
        If the <{source/type}> attribute is <em>not</em> specified, the user agent will not select
        a different <{source}> element if it finds that it does not support the image format after
        fetching it.
      </p>

      When a <{source}> element has a following sibling <{source}> element or <{img}> element with
      a <code>srcset</code> attribute specified, it must have at least one of the following:

      * A <{source/media}> attribute specified with a value that, after
          <a>stripping leading and trailing white space</a>, is not the empty string and is not an
          <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for the string "<code>all</code>".
      * A <{source/type}> attribute specified.

      The <code>src</code> attribute must not be present.
    </dd>

    <dt><{source}> element's parent is a <a>media element</a></dt>
    <dd>
      The <dfn element-attr for="source"><code>src</code></dfn> attribute gives the address of the
      <a>media resource</a>. The value must be a <a>valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded
      by spaces</a>. This attribute must be present.

      <p class="note">
        Dynamically modifying a <{source}> element and its attribute when the element is already
        inserted in a <{video}> or <{audio}> element will have no effect. To change what
        is playing, just use the <code>src</code> attribute on the <a>media element</a> directly,
        possibly making use of the <code>canPlayType()</code> method to pick from amongst available
        resources. Generally, manipulating <{source}> elements manually after the document has
        been parsed is an unnecessarily complicated approach.
      </p>

      The <{source/type}> content attribute gives the type of the <a>media resource</a>, to help
      the user agent determine if it can play this <a>media resource</a> before fetching it. If
      specified, its value must be a <a>valid MIME type</a>. The <code>codecs</code> parameter,
      which certain MIME types define, might be necessary to specify exactly how the resource
      is encoded. [[!RFC6381]]

      <div class="example">
        The following list shows some examples of how to use the <code>codecs=</code> MIME
        parameter in the <{source/type}> attribute.

  An <{img}> element represents an image and its <a>fallback content</a>.

  The image given by the <dfn element-attr for="img"><code>src</code></dfn> and <dfn element-attr for="img"><code>srcset</code></dfn> attributes,
  and any previous sibling <{source}> elements'
  <code>srcset</code> attributes if the parent is a <{picture}> element,
  is the embedded content; the value of
  the <dfn element-attr for="img"><code>alt</code></dfn> attribute and the content referred to by
  the <{img/longdesc}> attribute are the
  <{img}> element's <a>fallback content</a>, and provide equivalent content for
  users and user agents who cannot process images or have image loading disabled.

  Requirements for alternative representations of the image are described
  <a href="#alt-text">in the next section</a>.

  The <code>src</code> attribute must be present, and must contain a
  <a>valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces</a> referencing a non-interactive,
  optionally animated, image resource that is neither paged nor scripted.

  The <code>srcset</code> attribute may also be present.
  If present, its value must consist of one or more
  <a>image candidate strings</a>,
  each separated from the next by a U+002C COMMA character (,).
  If an <a>image candidate string</a> contains no descriptors
  and no [=space characters=] after the URL,
  the following <a>image candidate string</a>, if there is one,
  must begin with one or more [=space characters=].

  An <dfn>image candidate string</dfn> consists of the following components, in order, with the
  further restrictions described below this list:

  <ol>

    <li>Zero or more [=space characters=].</li>

    <li>A <a>valid non-empty URL</a> that does not start or end with a U+002C COMMA character (,),
    referencing a non-interactive, optionally animated, image resource
    that is neither paged nor scripted.</li>

    <li>Zero or more [=space characters=].</li>

    <li>

    Zero or one of the following:

    <ul>

      <li>A <dfn>width descriptor</dfn>, consisting of:
      a <a>space character</a>,
      a <a>valid non-negative integer</a> giving a number greater than zero
      representing the <dfn>width descriptor value</dfn>,
      and a U+0077 LATIN SMALL LETTER W character.</li>

      <li>A <i>pixel density descriptor</i>, consisting of:
      a <a>space character</a>,
      a <a>valid floating-point number</a> giving a number greater than zero
      representing the <i>pixel density descriptor</i> value,
      and a U+0078 LATIN SMALL LETTER X character.</li>

    </ul>

    </li>

    <li>Zero or more [=space characters=].</li>

  </ol>

  There must not be an <a>image candidate string</a> for an element that
  has the same <a>width descriptor value</a> as another
  <a>image candidate string</a>'s <a>width descriptor value</a> for the same element.

  There must not be an <a>image candidate string</a> for an element that has the same
  <i>pixel density descriptor</i> value as another <a>image candidate string</a>'s
  <i>pixel density descriptor</i> value for the same element.
  For the purpose of this requirement, an <a>image candidate string</a> with no descriptors
  is equivalent to an <a>image candidate string</a> with a <code>1x</code> descriptor.

  If a <{source}> element has a <code>sizes</code> attribute present
  or an <{img}> element has a <code>sizes</code> attribute present,
  all <a>image candidate strings</a> for that
  element must have the <a>width descriptor</a> specified.

  If an <a>image candidate string</a> for a <{source}> or
  <{img}> element has the <a>width descriptor</a> specified, all other
  <a>image candidate strings</a> for that element must also
  have the <a>width descriptor</a> specified.

  The specified width in an <a>image candidate string</a>'s <a>width descriptor</a>
  must match the <a for="css">intrinsic width</a> in the resource given by the
  <a>image candidate string</a>'s URL, if it has an <a for="css">intrinsic width</a>.

  <p class="note">
    The requirements above imply that images can be static bitmaps (e.g., PNGs, GIFs, JPEGs),
    single-page vector documents (single-page PDFs, XML files with an SVG <a>document element</a>), animated
    bitmaps (APNGs, animated GIFs), animated vector graphics (XML files with an SVG <a>document element</a>
    that use declarative SMIL animation), and so forth. However, these definitions preclude SVG
    files with script, multipage PDF files, interactive MNG files, HTML documents, plain text
    documents, and so forth. [[!PNG]] [[!GIF]] [[!JPEG]] [[!PDF]] [[!XML]] [[APNG]] [[!SVG11]] [[!MNG]]
  </p>

  If the <code>srcset</code> attribute is present,
  the <dfn element-attr for="img"><code>sizes</code></dfn> attribute may also be present.
  If present, its value must be a <a>valid source size list</a>.

  A <dfn>valid source size list</dfn> is a string that matches the following grammar:
  [[!CSS-VALUES]] [[!MEDIAQ]]

  <xmp highlight="html">
    <source-size-list> = <source-size># [ , <source-size-value> ]? | <source-size-value>
    <source-size> = <media-condition> <source-size-value>
    <source-size-value> = <length>
  </xmp>

  A <code>&lt;source-size-value&gt;</code> must not be negative.

  <p class="note">
    Percentages are not allowed in a <code>&lt;source-size-value&gt;</code>,
  to avoid confusion about what it would be relative to.
  The <code>vw</code> unit can be used for sizes relative to the <a>viewport</a> width.
  </p>

  The <{img}> element must not be used as a layout tool. In particular, <code>img</code>
  elements should not be used to display transparent images, as such images rarely convey meaning and
  rarely add anything useful to the document.

  <hr />

  The <dfn element-attr for="img"><code>crossorigin</code></dfn> attribute is a <a>CORS
  settings attribute</a>. Its purpose is to allow images from third-party sites that allow
  cross-origin access to be used with <{canvas}>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="img"><code>decoding</code></dfn> attribute is an enumerated attribute.
  It is an [=image decoding hint=] to request synchronous or asynchronous image loading.
  Valid values are "<code>sync</code>", "<code>async</code>", and "<code>auto</code>".
  The [=missing value default=] and [=invalid value default=] are both "<code>auto</code>".

  The <dfn element-attr for="img"><code>referrerpolicy</code></dfn> attribute is a <a>referrer policy attribute</a>.
  Its purpose is to set the <a>referrer policy</a> used when <a>fetching</a> the image. [[!REFERRERPOLICY]]

  <hr />

  An <{img}> element has a <dfn>current request</dfn> and a <dfn>pending request</dfn>.
  The <a>current request</a> is initially set to a new <a>image request</a>.
  The <a>pending request</a> is initially set to null.
  The <a>current request</a> is usually referred to as the <{img}> element itself.

  An <dfn>image request</dfn> has a <dfn for="image">state</dfn>, <dfn>current URL</dfn> and <dfn>image data</dfn>.

  An <a>image request</a>'s <a for="image">state</a> is one of the following:

  <dl>

    <dt><dfn state for="img" lt="Unavailable|unavailable">Unavailable</dfn></dt>
    <dd>The user agent hasn't obtained any image data,
    or has obtained some or all of the image data but
    hasn't yet decoded enough of the image to get the image dimensions.</dd>

    <dt><dfn state for="img" lt="Partially available|partially available">Partially available</dfn></dt>
    <dd>The user agent has obtained some of the image data and at least the image dimensions are
    available.</dd>

    <dt><dfn state for="img" lt="Completely available|completely available">Completely available</dfn></dt>
    <dd>The user agent has obtained all of the image data and at least the image dimensions are
    available.</dd>

    <dt><dfn state for="img" lt="Broken|broken">Broken</dfn></dt>
    <dd>The user agent has obtained all of the image data that it can, but it cannot even decode
    the image enough to get the image dimensions (e.g., the image is corrupted, or the format is
    not supported, or no data could be obtained).</dd>

  </dl>

  An <a>image request</a>'s <a>current URL</a> is initially the empty string.

  An <a>image request</a>'s <a>image data</a> is the decoded image data.

  When an <a>image request</a> is either in the <a state for="img">partially available</a> state or in the <a state for="img">completely available</a> state, it is
  said to be <dfn state for="img" lt="Available|available">available</dfn>.

  An <a>image request</a> is initially <a state for="img">unavailable</a>.

  When an <{img}> element is <a state for="img">available</a>,
  it provides a <a>paint source</a>
  whose width is the image's <a lt="density-corrected intrinsic width and height">
  density-corrected intrinsic width</a> (if any),
  whose height is the image's <a lt="density-corrected intrinsic width and height">
  density-corrected intrinsic height</a> (if any),
  and whose appearance is the intrinsic appearance of the image.

  In a <a>browsing context</a> where <a>scripting is
  disabled</a>, user agents may obtain images immediately or on demand. In a <a>browsing
  context</a> where <a>scripting is enabled</a>, user agents
  must obtain images immediately.

  A user agent that obtains images immediately must immediately
  <a>update the image data</a> of an <{img}> element,
  with the <i>restart animation</i> flag set if so stated,
  whenever that element is created or has experienced <a>relevant mutations</a>.

  A user agent that obtains images on demand must <a>update the image data</a> of an
  <{img}> element whenever it needs the image data (i.e., on demand),
  but only if the <{img}> element is in the
  <a state for="img">unavailable</a> state. When an <{img}> element
  has experienced <a>relevant mutations</a>, if the user
  agent only obtains images on demand, the <{img}> element must return to the <a state for="img">unavailable</a> state.

  The <dfn>relevant mutations</dfn> for an <{img}> element are as follows:

  <ul>

    <li>The element's <code>src</code>, <code>srcset</code>, <code>width</code>, or <code>sizes</code> attributes are set, changed, or removed.</li>

    <li>The element's <code>src</code> attribute is set to the same value as the previous value.
    This must set the <i>restart animation</i> flag for the <a>update the image data</a> algorithm.</li>

    <li>The element's <code>crossorigin</code> attribute's state is changed.</li>

    <li>The element is <a for="document">inserted into</a> or <a for="document">removed from</a> a <code>picture</code> parent element.</li>

    <li>The element's parent is a <{picture}> element and a <{source}> element is inserted as a
    previous sibling.</li>

    <li>The element's parent is a <{picture}> element and a
    <{source}> element that was a previous sibling is <a>removed</a>.</li>

    <li>The element's parent is a <{picture}> element and a
    <{source}> element that is a previous sibling has its
    <code>srcset</code>,
    <code>sizes</code>,
    <code>media</code>
    or <code>type</code> attributes set, changed, or removed.</li>

    <li>The element's <a>adopting steps</a> are run.</li>

  </ul>

  Each <{img}> element has a <dfn>last selected source</dfn>, which must initially be
  null.

  Each <a>image request</a> has a <dfn>current pixel density</dfn>, which must initially be undefined.

  When an <{img}> element has a <a>current pixel density</a> that is not 1.0, the
  element's image data must be treated as if its resolution, in device pixels per CSS pixels, was
  the <a>current pixel density</a>.
  The image's <dfn>density-corrected intrinsic width and height</dfn> are the <a>intrinsic width and height</a>
  after taking into account the <a>current pixel density</a>.

  <p class="example">For example, given a screen with 96 CSS pixels per CSS inch, if the
  <a>current pixel density</a> is 3.125, that means that there are 96 × 3.125 = 300 device
  pixels per CSS inch, and thus if the image data is 300x600, it has <a>intrinsic dimensions</a> of
  300 ÷ 3.125 = 96 CSS pixels by 600 ÷ 3.125 = 192 CSS pixels. With a <a>current pixel density</a>
  of 2.0 (192 device pixels per CSS inch) and the same image data (300x600), the <a>intrinsic
  dimensions</a> would be 150x300.</p>

  Each {{Document}} object must have a <dfn>list of available images</dfn>. Each image
  in this list is identified by a tuple consisting of an <a>absolute URL</a>, a <a>CORS
  settings attribute</a> mode, and, if the mode is not <a state for="cors">No CORS</a>, an
  [=concept/origin=].
  Each image furthermore has an <dfn>ignore higher-layer caching</dfn> flag.
  User agents may copy entries from one {{Document}}
  object's <a>list of available images</a> to another at any time (e.g., when the
  {{Document}} is created, user agents can add to it all the images that are loaded in
  other {{Document}}s), but must not change the keys of entries copied in this way when
  doing so, and must unset the <a>ignore higher-layer caching</a> flag for the copied entry.
  User agents may also remove images from such lists at any time (e.g., to save
  memory).
  User agents must remove entries in the <a>list of available images</a> as appropriate
  given higher-layer caching semantics for the resource (e.g., the HTTP <a http-header><code>Cache-Control</code></a>
  response header) when the <a>ignore higher-layer caching</a> flag is unset.

  <p class="note">
    The <a>list of available images</a> is intended to enable synchronous
  switching when changing the <code>src</code> attribute to a URL that has
  previously been loaded, and to avoid re-downloading images in the same document even when they
  don't allow caching per HTTP. It is not used to avoid re-downloading the same image while the
  previous image is still loading.
  </p>

  <p class="example">For example, if a resource has the HTTP response header <code>Cache-Control: must-revalidate</code>,
  the user agent would remove it from the <a>list of available images</a> but could keep the image data separately,
  and use that if the server responds with a <code>204 No Content</code> status.</p>

  Image <dfn lt="decode" for="image">decoding</dfn> is the process which converts
  an encoded image's data into a bitmap form for presentation. Implementations may
  choose when and what to decode for the best user experience.

  Image decoding is said to be synchronous if it prevents presentation of other
  content until it is finished. Typically, this has an effect of atomically
  presenting the image and any other content at the same time. However, this
  presentation is delayed by the amount of time it takes to perform the decode.

  Image decoding is said to be asynchronous if it does not prevent presentation of
  other content. This has an effect of presenting non-image content faster. However,
  the image content is missing on screen until the decode finishes. Once the decode
  is finished, the screen is updated with the image.

  In both synchronous and asynchronous decoding modes, the final content is
  presented to screen after the same amount of time has elapsed. The main
  difference is whether the user agent presents non-image content ahead of
  presenting the final content.

  In order to aid the user agent in deciding whether to perform synchronous or
  asynchronous decode, the <a element-attr for="img">decoding</a> attribute can
  be set on <{img}> elements. The possible values of the
  <a element-attr for="img">decoding</a> attribute are the following
  <dfn>image decoding hint</dfn> keywords:

  <table>
    <thead>
    <tr>

        <dfn state for="img">Sync</dfn>
      </td>
      <td>
        Indicates a preference to <a for="image">decode</a> this image synchronously
        for atomic presentation with other content.
      </td>

      <td>

      </td>
      <td>
        <dfn state for="img">Async</dfn>
      </td>
      <td>
        Indicates a preference to <a for="image">decode</a> this image asynchronously
        to avoid delaying presentation of other content.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <dfn attr-value for="img"><code>auto</code></dfn>
      </td>
      <td>
        <dfn state for="img">Auto</dfn>
      </td>
      <td>
        Indicates no preference in decoding mode (the default).
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  When decoding an image, the user agent should respect the preference indicated
  by the decoding attribute's state. If the state indicated is auto, then the
  user agent is free to choose any decoding behavior.

  When the user agent is to <dfn>update the image data</dfn> of an <{img}> element,
  optionally with the <i>restart animations</i> flag set,
  it must run the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>

    If the element's <a>node document</a> is not the <a>active document</a>,
    then run these substeps:

    <ol>

      <li>Continue running this algorithm <a>in parallel</a>.</li>

      <li>Wait until the element's <a>node document</a> is the <a>active document</a>.</li>

      <li>If another instance of this algorithm for this <{img}> element was started after this instance
      (even if it aborted and is no longer running), then abort these steps.</li>

      <li><a>Queue a microtask</a> to continue this algorithm.</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    <li>If the user agent cannot support images, or its support for images has been disabled, then
    <a>abort the image request</a> for the <a>current request</a> and the <a>pending request</a>,
    set <a>current request</a> to the <a state for="img">unavailable</a> state,
    let <a>pending request</a> be null,
    and abort these steps.</li>

    <li>

    If the element does not use <code>srcset</code> or <code>picture</code> and
    it does not have a parent or it has a parent but it is not a <{picture}> element,
    and it has a <code>src</code> attribute specified and
    its value is not the empty string, let <var>selected source</var> be the value of the
    element's <code>src</code> attribute, and <var>selected pixel
    density</var> be 1.0. Otherwise, let <var>selected source</var> be null and <var>selected pixel density</var> be undefined.

    </li>

    <li>Let the <{img}> element's <a>last selected source</a> be <var>selected source</var>.</li>

    <li>

    If <var>selected source</var> is not null, run these substeps:

      <li><a>Parse</a> <var>selected source</var>, relative

          <li><a>Queue a task</a> to <a>restart the animation</a> if <i>restart

  While a user agent is running the above algorithm for an element <var>x</var>, there
  must be a strong reference from the element's <a>node document</a> to the element <var>x</var>,
  even if that element is not in its <code>Document</code>.

  An <code>img</code> element is said to <dfn>use <code>srcset</code> or <code>picture</code></dfn>
  if it has a <{img/srcset}> attribute specified or if it has a parent that is a
  <code>picture</code> element.

  When an <{img}> element is in the <a state for="img">completely available</a>
  state <em>and</em> the user agent can decode the media data without errors, then the
  <{img}> element is said to be <dfn>fully decodable</dfn>.

  Whether the image is fetched successfully or not (e.g., whether the response status was an
  <a>ok status</a>) must be ignored when determining the image's type and whether it is a
  valid image.

  <p class="note">
    This allows servers to return images with error responses, and have them displayed.
  </p>

  The user agent should apply the <a>image sniffing rules</a> to determine the type of the image,
  with the image's <a>associated Content-Type headers</a> giving the <var>official type</var>. If
  these rules are not applied, then the type of the image must be the type given by the image's
  <a>associated Content-Type headers</a>.

  User agents must not support non-image resources with the <{img}> element (e.g., XML files whose
  <a>document element</a> is an HTML element). User agents must not run executable code (e.g.,
  scripts) embedded in the image resource. User agents must only display the first page of a
  multipage resource (e.g., a PDF file). User agents must not allow the resource to act in an
  interactive fashion, but should honor any animation in the resource.

  This specification does not specify which image types are to be supported.

  <hr />

  An <{img}> element is associated with a <a>source set</a>.

  A <dfn>source set</dfn> is an ordered set of zero or more <a>image sources</a>
  and a <a>source size</a>.

  An <dfn>image source</dfn> is a [=url/URL=],
  and optionally either a density descriptor, or a <a>width descriptor</a>.

  A <dfn>source size</dfn> is a <code>&lt;source-size-value&gt;</code>.
  When a <a>source size</a> has a unit relative to the <a>viewport</a>,
  it must be interpreted relative to the <{img}> element's document's <a>viewport</a>.
  Other units must be interpreted the same as in Media Queries. [[!MEDIAQ]]

  When asked to <dfn lt="selecting an image source|select an image source">select an image source</dfn> for a given <{img}>
  element <var>el</var>, user agents must do the following:

  <ol>

    <li><a>Update the source set</a> for <var>el</var>.</li>

    <li>If <var>el</var>'s <a>source set</a> is empty,
    return null as the URL and undefined as the pixel density and abort these steps.</li>

    <li>Otherwise, take <var>el</var>'s <a>source set</a>
    and let it be <var>source set</var>.</li>

    <li>If an entry <var>b</var> in <var>source set</var> has the same associated density descriptor
    as an earlier entry <var>a</var> in <var>source set</var>, then remove entry <var>b</var>.
    Repeat this step until none of the entries in <var>source set</var> have the same associated density descriptor as an earlier entry.</li>

    <li>In a user agent-specific manner,
    choose one <a>image source</a> from <var>source set</var>.
    Let this be <var>selected source</var>.</li>

    <li>Return <var>selected source</var> and its associated pixel density.</li>

  </ol>

  When asked to <dfn>update the source set</dfn> for a given <{img}> element <var>el</var>,
  user agents must do the following:

    Otherwise, let <var>elements</var> be array containing only <var>el</var>.</li>

    <li>If <var>el</var> has a <code>width</code> attribute, and parsing
    that attribute's value using the <a>rules for parsing dimension values</a> doesn't generate
    an error or a percentage value, then let <var>width</var> be the returned integer value.
    Otherwise, let <var>width</var> be null.</li>

    Iterate through <var>elements</var>,

  An <a>image source</a> can have a density descriptor,
  a <a>width descriptor</a>,
  or no descriptor at all accompanying its URL.
  Normalizing a <a>source set</a> gives every <a>image source</a> a density descriptor.

  When asked to <dfn>normalize the source densities</dfn> of a <a>source set</a> <var>source set</var>,

      with a value of the <a>width descriptor</a> divided by the <a>source size</a>
      and a unit of <code>x</code>.

      <p class="note">
        If the <a>source size</a> is zero, the density would be infinity,
        which results in the <a>intrinsic dimensions</a> being zero by zero.
      </p>

      </li>

      <li>Otherwise, give the <a>image source</a> a density descriptor of <code>1x</code>.</li>

    </ol>

  </ol>

  The user agent may at any time run the following algorithm to update an <code>img</code>
  element's image in order to react to changes in the environment. (User agents are <em>not
  required</em> to ever run this algorithm; for example, if the user is not looking at the page any
  more, the user agent might want to wait until the user has returned to the page before determining
  which image to use, in case the environment changes again in the meantime.)

  <p class="note">
    User agents are encouraged to run this algorithm in particular when the user changes the
    <a>viewport</a>'s size (e.g., by resizing the window or changing the page zoom),
    and when an <{img}> element is <a for="document">inserted into a document</a>,
    so that the <a>density-corrected intrinsic width and height</a> match the new <a>viewport</a>,

  What an <{img}> element represents depends on the <code>src</code> attribute and the <code>alt</code>
  attribute.

  <dl class="switch">

    <dt>If the <code>src</code> attribute is set and the <code>alt</code> attribute is set to the empty string (e.g. <code>alt=""</code> or <code>alt</code> without a set value)</dt>

    The image is either decorative or supplemental to the rest of the content, redundant with
    some other information in the document.

    If the image is <a>available</a> and the user agent is configured
    to display that image, then the element <a>represents</a> the element's image data.

    Otherwise, the element <a>represents</a> nothing, and may be omitted completely from
    the rendering. User agents may provide the user with a notification that an image is present but
    has been omitted from the rendering.

    </dd>

    <dt>If the <code>src</code> attribute is set and the <code>alt</code> attribute is set to a value that isn't empty</dt>

    <dd>

    The image is a key part of the content; the <code>alt</code> attribute
    gives a textual equivalent or replacement for the image.

    If the image is <a>available</a> and the user agent is configured
    to display that image, then the element <a>represents</a> the element's image data.

    Otherwise, the element <a>represents</a> the text given by the <code>alt</code> attribute. User agents may provide the user with a notification
    that an image is present but has been omitted from the rendering.

    </dd>

    <dt>If the <code>src</code> attribute is set and the <code>alt</code> attribute is not</dt>

    <dd>

    There is no textual equivalent of the image available.

    If the image is <a>available</a> and the user agent is configured
    to display that image, then the element <a>represents</a> the element's image data.

    Otherwise, the user agent should display some sort of indicator that there is an image that
    is not being rendered, and may, if requested by the user, or if so configured, or when required
    to provide contextual information in response to navigation, provide caption information for the
    image, derived as follows:

    <ol>

      <li>If the image is a descendant of a <{figure}> element that has a child
      <{figcaption}> element, and, ignoring the <{figcaption}> element and its
    descendants, the <{figure}> element has no {{Text}} node descendants other
    than <a>inter-element white space</a>, and no <a>embedded content</a> descendant
    other than the <{img}> element, then the contents of the first such

    <dd>

    The element <a>represents</a> nothing.

    <dt>Otherwise</dt>

    <dd>

    The element <a>represents</a> the text given by the <code>alt</code> attribute.

    </dd>

  </dl>

  The <code>alt</code> attribute does not represent advisory information.
  User agents must not present the contents of the <code>alt</code> attribute
  in the same way as content of the <{global/title}> attribute.

  User agents may always provide the user with the option to display any image, or to prevent any
  image from being displayed. User agents may also apply heuristics to help the user make use of the
  image when the user is unable to see it, e.g., due to a visual disability or because they are using
  a text terminal with no graphics capabilities. Such heuristics could include, for instance,
  optical character recognition (OCR) of text found within the image.

  <!-- W3C START - DO NOT OVERWRITE-->

  In the case where an <{img}> without an <code>alt</code> attribute is the child of a <{figure}>
  element with a non-empty <{figcaption}> element, the image's presence should be minimally conveyed
  to a user by Assistive Technology, typically by identifying the image <code>role</code>.

<h5 id="alt-text">Requirements for providing text to act as an alternative for images</h5>

  <a>Text alternatives</a>, [[WCAG20]]
  are a primary way of making visual information accessible, because they can be rendered through many
  sensory modalities (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) to match the needs of the user. Providing
  text alternatives allows the information to be rendered in a variety of ways by a variety of user agents.
  For example, a person who cannot see a picture can hear the text alternative read aloud using synthesized speech.

  <div class="note">

  The <{img/alt}> attribute on images is a very important accessibility attribute.
  Authoring useful <code>alt</code> attribute content requires the author to
  carefully consider the context in which the image appears and the function that
  image may have in that context.

  The <{img/longdesc}> attribute on images is likely to be read far less often by users
  and is necessary for far fewer images. Nevertheless it provides an important way for
  users who cannot see an image or cannot see it clearly, and user agents that cannot automatically process images,
  to understand what it shows. The <{img/longdesc}> attribute's use cases are more fully described in [[!html-longdesc]]

  The guidance included here addresses the most common ways authors use images.
  Additional guidance and techniques are available in <a>Resources on Alternative Text for Images</a>.
  </div>

<h6 id="examples-of-scenarios-where-users-benefit-from-text-alternatives-for-images">Examples of scenarios where users benefit from text alternatives for images</h6>

  <ul>
      <li>They have a very slow connection and are browsing with images disabled.</li>
      <li>They have a vision impairment and use text to speech software.</li>
      <li>They have a cognitive impairment and use text to speech software.</li>
      <li>They are using a text-only browser.</li>
      <li>They are listening to the page being read out by a voice Web browser.</li>
      <li>They have images disabled to save on download costs.</li>
      <li>They have problems loading images or the source of an image is wrong.</li>
    </ul>

<h6 id="general-guidelines">General guidelines</h6>

  Except where otherwise specified, the <code>alt</code> attribute must be specified and its value must not be empty;
  the value must be an appropriate functional replacement for the image. The specific requirements for the
  <code>alt</code> attribute content depend on the image's function in the page, as described in the following sections.

  To determine an appropriate text alternative it is important to think about why an image is being included in a page.
  What is its purpose? Thinking like this will help you to understand what is important about the image for the
  intended audience. Every image has a reason for being on a page, because it provides useful information, performs a
  function, labels an interactive element, enhances aesthetics or is purely decorative. Therefore, knowing what the image
  is for, makes writing an appropriate text alternative easier.

<h6 id="a-link-or-button-containing-nothing-but-an-image">A link or button containing nothing but an image</h6>

  When an <{a}> element that is a <a>hyperlink</a>, or a <{button}> element, has no text content
  but contains one or more images, include text in the <code>alt</code> attribute(s) that together convey the purpose of the link or button.

  <div class="example">
    In this example, a portion of an editor interface is displayed. Each button has an icon representing an action a user can take on content they are editing. For users who cannot view the images, the action names are included within the <code>alt</code> attributes of the images:

    <img src="images/buttons1.png" alt="5 buttons: bold, italic, strike through, bulleted list and numbered list." />

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <ul>
        <li><button><img src="b.png" alt="Bold"></button></li>

        <li><button><img src="strike.png" alt="Strike through"></button></li>
        <li><button><img src="blist.png" alt="Bulleted list"></button></li>
        <li><button><img src="nlist.png" alt="Numbered list"></button></li>
      </ul>
    </xmp>
  </div>

  <div class="example">

  Users can benefit when content is presented in graphical form, for example as a
  flowchart, a diagram, a graph, or a map showing directions. Users who are unable to view the image also benefit when
  content presented in a graphical form is provided in a text-based format. Software agents that process text content,
  but cannot automatically process images (e.g. translation services, many search engines), also benefit from a
  text-based description.

  <div class="example">
    In the following example we have an image of a pie chart, with text in the <code>alt</code>
    attribute representing the data shown in the pie chart:

    <img src="images/browserShare.png" width="380" height="299" alt="Browser Share: Internet Explorer 25%, Firefox 40%, Chrome 25%, Safari 6% and Opera 4%." />

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <img src="piechart.gif" alt="Pie chart: Browser Share - Internet Explorer 25%, Firefox 40%, Chrome 25%, Safari 6% and Opera 4%.">
    </xmp>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    In the case where an image repeats the previous paragraph in graphical form. The
    <{img/alt}> attribute content labels the image and the <{img/longdesc}> attribute identifies it as a description.

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <p id="graph7">According to a recent study Firefox has a 40% browser share,
        Internet Explorer has 25%, Chrome has 25%, Safari has 6% and Opera has 4%.</p>
      <p><img src="piechart.gif" alt="The browser shares as a pie chart."
        longdesc="#graph7"></p>
    </xmp>

    It can be seen that when the image is not available, for example because the <code>src</code>
    attribute value is incorrect, the text alternative provides the user with a brief description of
    the image content:

    <img src="images/brokenimg.png" alt="Representation of the code snippet above." />
  </div>

  <p class="note">
    In cases where the text alternative is lengthy, more than a sentence or two, or would benefit
    from the use of structured markup, provide a brief description or label using the
    <code>alt</code> attribute, and an associated text alternative.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    Here's an example of a flowchart image, with a short text alternative
    included in the <code>alt</code> attribute, in this case the text alternative is a description of the link target
    as the image is the sole content of a link. The link points to a description, within the same document, of the
    process represented in the flowchart.

    <img width="221" height="320" src="images/flowchart.png" alt="Flowchart: Dealing with a broken lamp." />

<h6 id="images-of-text">Images of text</h6>

  Sometimes, an image only contains  text, and the purpose of the image
  is to display text  using visual effects and /or fonts.  It is <em>strongly</em>
  recommended that text styled using CSS be used, but if this is not possible, provide
  the same text in the <code>alt</code> attribute as is in the image.

  <div class="example">
    This example shows an image of the text "Get Happy!" written in a fancy multi colored freehand
    style. The image makes up the content of a heading. In this case the text alternative for the
    image is "Get Happy!".

    <img src="images/text.png" alt="Get Happy!" width="275" height="77" />

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <h1><img src="gethappy.gif" alt="Get Happy!"></h1>
    </xmp>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    In this example we have an advertising image consisting of text, the phrase "The BIG sale" is
    repeated 3 times, each time the text gets smaller and fainter, the last line reads "...ends Friday"
    In the context of use, as an advertisement, it is recommended that the image's text alternative only include the text "The BIG sale"
    once as the repetition is for visual effect and the repetition of the text for users who cannot view
    the image is unnecessary and could be confusing.

    <img src="images/sale.png" alt="The big sale ...ends Friday." width="400" height="190" />
    <xmp highlight="html">
      <p><img src="sale.gif" alt="The BIG sale ...ends Friday."></p>
    </xmp>
    <p class="note">
      In situations where there is also a photo or other graphic along with the image of text,
      ensure that the words in the image text are included in the text alternative, along with any other description
      of the image that conveys meaning to users who can view the image, so the information is also
      available to users who cannot view the image.
    </p>
  </div>
  When an image is used to represent a character that cannot otherwise be represented in Unicode,
  for example gaiji, itaiji, or new characters such as novel currency symbols, the alternative text
  should be a more conventional way of writing the same thing, e.g., using the phonetic hiragana or
  katakana to give the character's pronunciation.

  <div class="example">
    In this example from 1997, a new-fangled currency symbol that looks like a curly E with two
    bars in the middle instead of one is represented using an image. The alternative text gives the
    character's pronunciation.

    Only <img width="21" height="18" src="images/euro.png" alt="euro " />5.99!

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <p>Only <img src="euro.png" alt="euro ">5.99!
    </xmp>

  </div>

  An image should not be used if Unicode characters would serve an identical purpose. Only when
  the text cannot be directly represented using Unicode, e.g., because of decorations or because the
  character is not in the Unicode character set (as in the case of gaiji), would an image be
  appropriate.

  <p class="note">
    If an author is tempted to use an image because their default system font does not
  support a given character, then Web Fonts are a better solution than images.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    An illuminated manuscript might use graphics for some of its letters. The text alternative in
    such a situation is just the character that the image represents.
    <img width="24" height="32" src="images/fancyO.png" alt="O" />nce upon a time and a long long time ago...
    <pre highlight="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="initials/fancyO.png" <mark>alt="O"</mark>&gt;nce upon a time and a long long time ago...
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    Where the design of the illuminated letter is important, the primary text alternative in
    is the character that the image represents, and <{img/longdesc}> can provide a link to a more detailed description:
    <img width="24" height="32" src="images/drop_o.jpg" alt="O" longdesc="http://www.reusableart.com/drop_o.html"/>nce upon a time and a long long time ago...
    <pre highlight="html">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="initials/story-o.jpg" <mark>alt="O"</mark> longdesc="letters/story-0.html"&gt;nce
  upon a time and a long long time ago...
    </pre>
  </div>

<h6 id="images-that-include-text">Images that include text</h6>

  Sometimes, an image consists of a graphics such as a chart and associated text.
  In this case it is recommended that the text in the image is included in the text alternative.

  <div class="example">
    Consider an image containing a pie chart and associated text. It is recommended wherever
    possible to provide any associated text as text, not an image of text.
    If this is not possible include the text in the text alternative along with the pertinent
    information conveyed in the image.

  <img src="images/figure1.png" alt="Figure 1. Distribution of Articles by Journal
  Category. Pie chart: Language=68%, Education=14% and Science=18%." id="piechart" width="351" height="279">
  <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="figure1.gif" <strong>alt="Figure 1. Distribution of Articles by Journal Category.
  Pie chart: Language=68%, Education=14% and Science=18%."</strong>&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
  Here's another example of the same pie chart image,
  showing a short text alternative included in the <code>alt</code> attribute
  and a longer text alternative in text. The <code>figure</code> and <code>figcaption</code>
  elements are used to associate the longer text alternative with the image. The <code>alt</code> attribute is used
  to label the image.

  <xmp highlight="html">
    <figure>
      <img src="figure1.gif" alt="Figure 1">
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure 1.</strong> Distribution of Articles by Journal Category. Pie chart: Language=68%, Education=14% and Science=18%.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </xmp>

  <p class="note">
    The advantage of this method over the previous example is that the text alternative
  is available to all users at all times. It also allows structured mark up to be used in the text
  alternative, where as a text alternative provided using the <code>alt</code> attribute does not.
  </p>
  </div>

<h6 id="images-that-enhance-the-themes-or-subject-matter-of-the-page-content">Images that enhance the themes or subject matter of the page content</h6>

  An image that isn't discussed directly by the surrounding text but still has some relevance can
  be included in a page using the <{img}> element. Such images are more than mere decoration, they
  may augment the themes or subject matter of the page content and so still form part of the
  content. In these cases, it is recommended that a text alternative be provided.

  <div class="example">
  Here is an example of an image closely related to the subject matter of the page content
  but not directly discussed. An image of a painting inspired by a poem, on a page reciting that poem.
  The following snippet shows an example. The image is a painting titled the "Lady of Shallot", it is
  inspired by the poem and its subject matter is derived from the poem. Therefore it is strongly
  recommended that a text alternative is provided. There is a short description of the content of
  the image in the <code>alt</code> attribute and
  a link below the image to a longer description located at the bottom of the document. At the end
  of the longer description there is also a link to further information about the painting.

  It is not always easy to write a useful text alternative for an image, another option is to provide a link to a
  description or further information about the image when one is available.
  In this example of  the same image, there is a short text alternative included in the <code>alt</code> attribute, and
  there is a link after the image. The link points to a page containing <a>information about the painting</a>.

<h6 id="a-graphical-representation-of-some-of-the-surrounding-text">A graphical representation of some of the surrounding text</h6>

  In many cases, the image is actually just supplementary, and its presence merely reinforces the
  surrounding text. In these cases, the <code>alt</code> attribute must be
  present but its value must be unset or the empty string.

  In general, an image falls into this category if removing the image doesn't make the page any
  less useful, but including the image makes it a lot easier for users of visual browsers to
  understand the concept.

  <div class="example">
    This example includes a screenshot of part of a text editor with the file described in
    the instruction, displayed:

    <p>
      In the text file, add <code>SleepMode=1</code> under <code>[options]</code>, then save and close.

<h6 id="a-purely-decorative-image-that-doesnt-add-any-information">A purely decorative image that doesn't add any information</h6>

  Purely decorative images are visual enhancements, decorations or embellishments that provide no
  function or information beyond aesthetics to users who can view the images.

  Mark up purely decorative images so they can be ignored by assistive technology by using an
  <code>alt</code> attribute with no value (e.g. <code>alt=""</code> or <code>alt</code> with
  no set value). While it is not unacceptable to include decorative images inline,
  it is recommended if they are purely decorative to include the image using CSS.

  <div class="example">
    Here's an example of an image being used as a decorative banner for a person's blog,
    the image offers no information and so an <code>alt</code> attribute with no set value
    is used.

    <img src="images/border.png" alt width="400" height="30" />

    <div>
      <strong>Clara's Blog</strong>

<h6 id="inline-images">Inline images</h6>

  When images are used inline as part of the flow of text in a sentence, provide a word or
  phrase as a text alternative which makes sense in the context of the sentence it is a part of.

  <div class="example">
    I <img src="images/heart.png" alt="love" width="27" height="24" /> you.

    <xmp highlight="html">I <img src="heart.png" alt="love"> you.</xmp>

    My <img src="images/heart.png" alt="heart" width="27" height="24" /> breaks.

<h6 id="a-group-of-images-that-form-a-single-larger-picture-with-no-links">A group of images that form a single larger picture with no links</h6>

  When a picture has been sliced into smaller image files that are then displayed
  together to form the complete picture again, include a text alternative for one
  of the images using the <code>alt</code> attribute as per the relevant
  guidance for the picture as a whole, and then include an empty <code>alt</code>
  attribute on the other images.

  <div class="example">
    In this example, a picture representing a company logo for the <i>PIP Corporation</i>
    has been split into two pieces, the first containing the letters "PIP" and the second with
    the word "CO". The text alternative <i>PIP CO</i> is in the <code>alt</code> attribute of the first image.

  <img src="images/pip.gif" alt="Image containing the text 'PIP'." width="99" height="64" /><img src="images/co.gif" alt="Image containing the text 'CO'." width="103" height="64" />

  <xmp highlight="html">

  been "★★★☆☆", the author has

  If an <{img}> element has a <code>usemap</code> attribute which references a <{map}> element containing
  <{area}> elements that have <code>href</code> attributes, the <code>img</code> is considered to be interactive content.
  In such cases, always provide a text alternative for the image using the <code>alt</code> attribute.<p></p>
  <div class="example">
    Consider the following image which is a map of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katoomba,_New_South_Wales">Katoomba</a>,
    it has 2 interactive regions corresponding to the areas of North and South Katoomba:

    <img src="images/imagemap.png" width="209" height="249" alt="Map of Katoomba." usemap="#Map" />
    <map name="Map">
      <area shape="poly" coords="78,124,124,10,189,29,173,93,168,132,136,151,110,130" href="#" alt="North Katoomba">

    </map>
    The text alternative is a brief description of the image. The <code>alt</code> attribute on each
    of the <{area}> elements provides text describing the content of the target page of each linked region:

  <pre highlight="html">

  Sometimes, when you create a composite picture from multiple images, you may wish to
  link one or more of the images. Provide an <code>alt</code> attribute
  for each linked image to describe the purpose of the link.

  <div class="example">
  In the following example, a composite picture is used to represent a "crocoduck"; a fictional creature which
  defies evolutionary principles by being part crocodile and part duck. You are asked to interact with the
  crocoduck, but you need to exercise caution...

    the beast further.</p>

<h6 id="images-of-pictures">Images of Pictures</h6>

  Images of pictures or graphics include visual representations of objects, people, scenes, abstractions, etc.
  This <a>non-text content</a>, [[WCAG20]] can convey a significant amount of
  information visually or provide a <a>specific sensory experience</a>, [[WCAG20]] to
  a sighted person. Examples include photographs, paintings, drawings and artwork.

  An appropriate text alternative for a picture is a brief description, or name [[WCAG20]]. As in all text alternative authoring decisions, writing suitable text alternatives for pictures requires
  human judgment. The text value is subjective to the context where the image is used and the page author's writing style. Therefore,
  there is no single "right" or "correct" piece of <code>alt</code> text for any particular image. In  addition to providing a short text
  alternative that gives a brief description of the <a>non-text content</a>, also providing supplemental content through another means when
  appropriate may be useful.

    <div class="example">
  This first example shows an image uploaded to a photo-sharing site. The photo is of a cat, sitting in the bath. The image has a
  text alternative provided using the <{img}> element's <code>alt</code> attribute. It also has a caption provided by including
  the <{img}> element in a <{figure}> element and using a <{figcaption}> element to identify the caption text.

  <img src="images/lola.png" alt="Lola the cat sitting under an umbrella in the bath tub." width="300" height="242" />

  Lola prefers a bath to a shower.

  <xmp highlight="html">

  </xmp>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
  This example is of an image that defies a complete description, as the subject of the image is open to interpretation.
  The image has a text alternative in the <code>alt</code> attribute which gives users who cannot view the image a sense
  of what the image is. It also has a caption provided by including the <{img}> element in a <code>figure</code>
  element and using a <{figcaption}> element to identify the caption text.

  <img src="images/inkblot1.png" alt="An abstract, freeform, vertically symmetrical, black inkblot on a light background." width="300" height="197" />

<h6 id="webcam-images">Webcam images</h6>

  Webcam images are static images that are automatically updated periodically. Typically the images are
  from a fixed viewpoint, the images may update on the page automatically as each new image is uploaded from
  the camera or the user may be required to refresh the page to view an updated image. Examples include traffic
  and weather cameras.

  <div class="example">
  This example is fairly typical; the title and a time stamp are included in the image, automatically generated
  by the webcam software. It would be better if the text information was not included in the image, but as it is part
  of the image, include it as part of the text alternative. A caption is also provided using the <{figure}>
  and <{figcaption}> elements.  As the image is provided to give a visual indication of the current weather near a building,
  a link to a local weather forecast is provided, as with automatically generated and uploaded webcam images it may be impractical to
  provide such information as a text alternative.

  The text of the <code>alt</code> attribute includes a prose version of the timestamp, designed to make the text more
  understandable when announced by text to speech software.  The text alternative also includes a description of some aspects
  of what can be seen in the image which are unchanging, although weather conditions and time of day change.

  <img src="images/webcam1.png" alt="Sopwith house weather cam. Taken on the 21/04/10 at 11:51 and 34 seconds. In the foreground are the safety

<h6 id="when-a-text-alternative-is-not-available-at-the-time-of-publication">When a text alternative is not available at the time of publication</h6>

  In some cases an image is included in a published document, but the author is unable to provide an appropriate text alternative.
  In such cases the minimum requirement is to provide a caption for the image using the <code>figure</code> and <code>figcaption</code>
  elements under the following conditions:

  <ul>
  <li><dfn lt="the conditions described above|described above"></dfn>The <{img}> element is in a <{figure}> element
  </li><li>The <{figure}> element contains a <{figcaption}> element
  </li><li>The <{figcaption}> element contains content other than inter-element white space
  </li><li>Ignoring the <{figcaption}> element and its descendants, the <code>figure</code>
  element has no {{Text}} node descendants other than inter-element white space, and no
  embedded content descendant other than the <{img}> element.
  </li></ul>

  <p class="note">
    In other words, the only content of the <code>figure</code> is an <{img}> element and a <code>figcaption</code>
  element, and the <{figcaption}> element must include (caption) content.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    Such cases are to be kept to an absolute
    minimum. If there is even the slightest possibility of the author
    having the ability to provide real alternative text, then it would
    not be acceptable to omit the <code>alt</code>
    attribute.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
  In this example, a person uploads a photo, as part of a bulk upload of many images, to a photo sharing site. The user has not
  provided a text alternative or a caption for the image. The site's authoring tool inserts a caption automatically using whatever useful
  information it has for the image. In this case it's the file name and date the photo was taken.
  <p class="warning">The caption text in the example below is not a suitable text alternative and is
  not conforming to the Web Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. [[WCAG20]]</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="images/clara.png" alt="no text alternative provided" width="300" height="258" />
    <figcaption>clara.jpg, taken on 12/11/2010.</figcaption>

      <img src="clara.jpg">
      <figcaption>clara.jpg, taken on 12/11/2010.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </xmp>

  Notice that even in this example, as much useful information as possible is
  still included in the <{figcaption}> element.
    </div>

    <div class="example">
  In this second example, a person uploads a photo to a photo sharing site. She has provided
  a caption for the image but not a text alternative. This may be because the site does not provide users with the ability
  to add a text alternative in the <code>alt</code> attribute.

  <figure>
    <img src="images/elo.png" alt="no text alternative provided" width="205" height="250" />
    <figcaption>Eloisa with Princess Belle</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <xmp highlight="html">

    </div>

    <div class="example">
      Sometimes the entire point of the image is that a textual
      description is not available, and the user is to provide the
      description. For example, software that displays images and
      asks for alternative text precisely for the purpose of then
      writing a page with correct alternative text. Such a page could
      have a table of images, like this:

      <xmp highlight="html">
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Image</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <figure>
                <img src="2421.png">
                <figcaption>Image 640 by 100, filename 'banner.gif'</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </td>
            <td>
              <input name="alt2421">
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              <figure>
                <img src="2422.png">
                <figcaption>Image 200 by 480, filename 'ad3.gif'</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </td>
            <td>
              <input name="alt2422">
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </xmp>

    </div>

  <p class="note">
    Since some users cannot use images at all (e.g., because they are blind) the
  <code>alt</code> attribute is only allowed to be omitted when no text
  alternative is available and none can be made available, as in the above examples.
  </p>

<h6 id="an-image-not-intended-for-the-user">An image not intended for the user</h6>

  Generally authors should avoid using <{img}> elements
  for purposes other than showing images.

  If an <{img}> element is being used for purposes other
  than showing an image, e.g., as part of a service to count page
  views, use an empty <code>alt</code> attribute.

  <div class="example">
  An example of an <{img}> element used to collect web page statistics.
  The <code>alt</code> attribute is empty as the image has no meaning.

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <img src="https://stats.example.com/count?site=w3.org" width="0" height="0" alt="">
    </xmp>
  </div>

  <p class="note">
    It is recommended for the example use above the <code>width</code> and
  <code>height</code> attributes  be set to zero.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
  Another example use is when an image such as a <i>spacer.gif</i> is used to aid positioning of content.
  The <code>alt</code> attribute is empty as the image has no meaning.

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <img src="spacer.gif" width="10" height="10" alt="">
    </xmp>
  </div>

  <p class="note">
    It is recommended that CSS be used to position content instead of <{img}> elements.
  </p>

<h6 id="icon-images">Icon Images</h6>

  An icon is usually a simple picture representing a program, action, data file or a concept.
  Icons are intended to help users of visual browsers to recognize features at a glance.

  Use an empty <code>alt</code> attribute when an icon is supplemental to
  text conveying the same meaning.

  <div class="example">
    In this example, we have a link pointing to a site's home page, the link contains a
    house icon image and the text "home". The image has an empty <code>alt</code> text.

    <img src="images/home.png" alt="A house icon next to the word 'home'." width="100" height="38" />

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <a href="home.html"><img src="home.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="">Home</a>
    </xmp>

    Where images are used in this way, it would also be appropriate to add the image using CSS.

    <xmp highlight="css">
      #home:before {
        content: url(home.png);
      }
    </xmp>

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <a href="home.html" id="home">Home</a>
    </xmp>
  </div>

    <div class="example">
  In this example, there is a warning message, with a warning icon. The word "Warning!" is in emphasized
  text next to the icon. As the information conveyed by the icon is redundant the <{img}> element is given an empty <code>alt</code> attribute.

      <img src="images/warning.png" alt="Warning!" width="38" height="34"> <strong>Warning!</strong> Your session is about to expire.

      <xmp highlight="html">
        <p>
          <img src="warning.png" width="38" height="34" alt="">
          <strong>Warning!</strong> Your session is about to expire.
        </p>
      </xmp>
    </div>

  When an icon conveys additional information not available in text, provide a text alternative.

    <div class="example">
      In this example, there is a warning message, with a warning icon. The icon emphasizes the
      importance of the message and identifies it as a particular type of content.

      <img src="images/warning.png" alt="Warning!" width="38" height="34"> <strong>Your session is about to expire.</strong>

      <xmp highlight="html">
        <p>
          <img src="warning.png" width="38" height="34" alt="Warning!">
          <strong>Your session is about to expire.</strong>
        </p>
      </xmp>
    </div>

<h6 id="logos-insignia-flags-or-emblems">Logos, insignia, flags, or emblems</h6>

  Many pages include logos, insignia, flags, or emblems, which stand for a company, organization, project,
  band, software package, country, or other entity. What can be considered as an appropriate text alternative depends upon,
  like all images, the context in which the image is being used and what function it serves in the given context.

  If a logo is the sole content of a link, provide a brief description of the link target in the <code>alt</code> attribute.

  <div class="example">
    This example illustrates the use of the HTML5 logo as the sole content of a link to the HTML specification.

    <a href="https://w3c.github.io/html/"><img src="images/HTML5_Logo.png" alt="HTML 5.1 Nightly specification" width="128" height="128"></a>

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <a href="https://w3c.github.io/html/"><img src="HTML5_Logo.png" alt="HTML 5.1 specification"></a>
    </xmp>
  </div>

  If a logo is being used to represent the entity, e.g., as a page heading, provide the name of the
  entity being represented by the logo as the text alternative.

  <div class="example">
    This example illustrates the use of the WebPlatform.org logo being used to represent itself.

    <img src="images/logo-with-text.png" alt="WebPlatform.org" width="110" height="100"> and other developer resources

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <h2>
        <img src="images/webplatform.png" alt="WebPlatform.org">
        and other developer resources
      </h2>
    </xmp>

    <p class="note">
      The text alternative in the example above could also include the word "logo" to describe the
      type of image content. If so, it is suggested that square brackets be used to delineate this
      information: <code>alt="[logo] WebPlatform.org"</code>.
    </p>
  </div>

  If a logo is being used next to the name of the what that it represents, then the logo is
  supplemental. Include an empty <code>alt</code> attribute as the text alternative is already
  provided.

  <div class="example">
    This example illustrates the use of a logo next to the name of the organization it represents.

    <img src="images/webplatform.png" alt="" width="72" height="68" /> WebPlatform.org

    <xmp highlight="html"><img src="images/webplatform1.png" alt=""> WebPlatform.org</xmp>
  </div>

  If the logo is used alongside text discussing the subject or entity the logo represents, then
  provide a text alternative which describes the logo.

  <div class="example">
    This example illustrates the use of a logo next to text discussing the subject the logo
    represents.

    <p style="float:left;">

<h6 id="captcha-images">CAPTCHA Images</h6>

  CAPTCHA stands for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart".
  CAPTCHA images are used for security purposes to confirm that content is being accessed by a
  person rather than a computer. This authentication is done through visual verification of an
  image. CAPTCHA typically presents an image with characters or words in it that the user is to
  re-type. The image is usually distorted and has some noise applied to it to make the characters
  difficult to read.

  To improve the accessibility of CAPTCHA provide text alternatives that identify and describe the
  purpose of the image, and provide alternative forms of the CAPTCHA using output modes for
  different types of sensory perception. For instance provide an audio alternative along with the
  visual image. Place the audio option right next to the visual one. This helps but is still
  problematic for people without sound cards, the deaf-blind, and some people with limited hearing.
  Another method is to include a form that asks a question along with the visual image. This helps
  but can be problematic for people with cognitive impairments.

  <p class="note">
    It is strongly recommended that alternatives to CAPTCHA be used, as all forms of CAPTCHA
    introduce unacceptable barriers to entry for users with disabilities. Further information is
    available in <a>Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA</a>.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    This example shows a CAPTCHA test which uses a distorted image of text. The text alternative in
    the <code>alt</code> attribute provides instructions for a user in the case where she cannot
    access the image content.

  <img src="images/captcha.png" alt="captcha containing the words 'aides' and 'sprucest'. The letters are distorted and the color of the letters and background is partially inverted," width="270" height="60" />

  <strong>Example code:</strong>

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <img src="captcha.png" alt="If you cannot view this image an audio challenge is provided.">

<h6 id="an-image-in-a-picture-element">An image in a <{picture}> element</h6>

  The <{picture}> element and any <{source}> elements it contains have no semantics for users,
  only the <{img}> element or its text alternative is displayed to users. Provide a text alternative for an
  <{img}> element without regard to it being within a <{picture}> element. Refer to
  <a href="#alt-text">Requirements for providing text to act as an alternative for images</a> for more information on how to provide
  useful <code>alt</code> text for images.

  <p class="note">
    <a for="image">Art directed</a> images that rely on <code>picture</code> need to depict
    the same content (irrespective of size, pixel density, or any other discriminating
    factor). Therefore the appropriate text alternative for an image will always be the
    same irrespective of which source file ends up being chosen by the browser.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    <xmp highlight="html">

    The large and small versions (both versions are displayed for demonstration purposes) of
    the image portray the same scene: Reflection of a girls face in a train window,
    while the small version (displayed on smaller screens) is cropped, this does not effect the subject matter
    or the appropriateness of the <code>alt</code> text.

<h6 id="guidance-for-markup-generators">Guidance for markup generators</h6>

  Wherever possible, markup generators (such as WYSIWYG authoring tools) should obtain
  alternative text from their users. However, it is recognized that in many cases obtaining
  alternative text from users may not be possible.

  For images that are the sole contents of links, markup generators should examine the link
  target to determine the title of the target, or the URL of the target, and use information
  obtained in this manner as the alternative text.

  For images that have captions, markup generators should use the
  <{figure}> and <{figcaption}> elements to provide the image's caption.

  As a last resort, implementors
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_b23">must omit the alt attribute altogether</a>.
  [[!ATAG20]]

  <div class="note">
    Setting an <{image}> element's <{img/alt}> attribute to the empty string means the image in
    question provides no essential information. Assistive technology, such as screen readers,
    will typically ignore the presence of such an image, as ignoring it will not stop the user
    from understanding the document, and saves the user time.

    In the following example, the <{img/alt}> is set to the empty string, so it will be silently
    ignored by screen readers.

    <xmp highlight="html" class="example">
      <img src="bar-graph.png" alt="">
    </xmp>

    Unless the image is truly decorative, implementors setting an image's <code>alt</code>
    attribute to the empty string is not recommended. An empty string will indicate to content
    management software and accessibility checking software that the image does not need
    alternative text, and therefore they will not flag the image in question as a potential
    problem, meaning it is less likely to be repaired.

    In contrast, if an image is vital to understanding the contents of a document, implementors
    should be aware that an image without an <{img/alt}> attribute is preferable to an
    <{img/alt}> attribute set to the empty string.

    Taking the previous example and omitting the <code>alt</code> attribute, as follows:

    <xmp highlight="html" class="example">
      <img src="bar-graph.png">
    </xmp>

    will allow screen readers to announce the filename of the image (bar-graph.png). Doing so may
    allow the user to try to learn what the image conveys, e.g. from its announced filename,
    asking a friend to describe it, running Optical Character Recognition to see if the image
    contains text, or submitting it to an image search to get more information, etc.

    (None of these approaches are as good as giving the image correct alternative text).
  </div>

  Markup generators may specify a <dfn><code>generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt</code></dfn>
  attribute on <{img}> elements for which they have been  unable to obtain a text alternative and
  for which they have therefore omitted the <code>alt</code> attribute. The value of this
  attribute must be the empty string. Documents containing such attributes are not conforming,
  but conformance checkers will silently ignore this error.

  <p class="note">
    This is intended to avoid markup generators from being pressured into replacing the error of
    omitting the <code>alt</code> attribute with the even more egregious error of providing phony
    text alternatives, because state-of-the-art automated conformance checkers cannot distinguish
    phony text alternatives from correct text alternatives.
  </p>

  Markup generators should generally avoid using the image's own
  file name as the text alternative. Similarly, markup generators
  should avoid generating text alternatives from any content that will
  be equally available to presentation user agents (e.g., Web
  browsers).

  <p class="note">
    This is because once a page is generated, it will
  typically not be updated, whereas the browsers that later read the
  page can be updated by the user, therefore the browser is likely to
  have more up-to-date and finely-tuned heuristics than the markup
  generator did when generating the page.
  </p>

<h6 id="guidance-for-conformance-checkers">Guidance for conformance checkers</h6>

  A conformance checker must report the lack of an <code>alt</code> attribute as an error unless one
  of the conditions listed below applies:

  * The <{img}> element is in a <{figure}> element that satisfies
     <a>the conditions described above</a>.
  * The <{img}> element has a (non-conforming) <code>generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt</code>
    attribute whose value is the empty string. A conformance checker that is not reporting the lack
    of an <code>alt</code> attribute as an error must also not report the presence of the empty
    <code>generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt</code> attribute as an error. (This case does not
    represent a case where the document is conforming, only that the generator could not determine
    appropriate alternative text — validators are not required to show an error in this case,
    because such an error might encourage markup generators to include bogus alternative text purely
    in an attempt to silence validators. Naturally, conformance checkers <em>may</em> report the
    lack of an <code>alt</code> attribute as an error even in the presence of the
    <code>generator-unable-to-provide-required-alt</code> attribute; for example, there could be a
    user option to report <em>all</em> conformance errors even those that might be the more or less
    inevitable result of using a markup generator.)

  The <{iframe}> element <a>represents</a> a <a>nested browsing context</a>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="iframe"><code>src</code></dfn> attribute gives the address of a page
  that the <a>nested browsing context</a> is to contain. The attribute, if present, must be a
  <a>valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces</a>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="iframe"><code>srcdoc</code></dfn> attribute gives the content of
  the page that the <a>nested browsing context</a> is to contain. The value of the attribute
  is the source of <dfn>an `iframe` `srcdoc` document</dfn>.

  The <code>srcdoc</code> attribute, if present, must have a value
  using <a href="#syntax">the HTML syntax</a> that consists of the following syntactic components, in the
  given order:

  <ol>

    <li>Any number of [=comments=] and [=space characters=].</li>

    <li>Any number of [=comments=] and [=space characters=].</li>

    <li>The <a>document element</a>, in the form of an <{html}> element.</li>

    Notice the way that quotes have to be escaped (otherwise the <code>srcdoc</code> attribute would end prematurely), and the way raw
    ampersands (e.g., in URLs or in prose) mentioned in the sandboxed content have to be
    <em>doubly</em> escaped — once so that the ampersand is preserved when originally parsing
    the <code>srcdoc</code> attribute, and once more to prevent the
    ampersand from being misinterpreted when parsing the sandboxed content.

    Furthermore, notice that since the [=DOCTYPE=] is optional in
    <a lt="an iframe srcdoc document">`iframe` `srcdoc` documents</a>, and the <{html}>,
    <{head}>, and <{body}> elements have <a>optional
    start and end tags</a>, and the <{title}> element is also optional in <a lt="an iframe srcdoc document">`iframe` `srcdoc` documents</a>, the markup in a <code>srcdoc</code> attribute can be
    relatively succinct despite representing an entire document, since only the contents of the
    <{body}> element need appear literally in the syntax. The other elements are still
    present, but only by implication.

  </div>

  <p class="note">
    In <a href="#syntax">the HTML syntax</a>, authors need only remember to use U+0022
    QUOTATION MARK characters (") to wrap the attribute contents and then to escape all U+0026
    AMPERSAND (&amp;) and U+0022 QUOTATION MARK (") characters, and to specify the
    <{iframe/sandbox}> attribute, to ensure safe embedding of content.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    Due to restrictions of <a href="#xhtml">the XHTML syntax</a>, in XML
    the U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN character (&lt;) needs to be escaped as well.
    In order to prevent <a>attribute-value normalization</a>, some of XML's
    white space characters — specifically U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab), U+000A LINE FEED
    (LF), and U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) — also need to be escaped. [[!XML]]
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    If the <code>src</code> attribute and the <code>srcdoc</code> attribute are both specified
    together, the <code>srcdoc</code> attribute takes priority. This allows authors to provide
    a fallback [=url/URL=] for legacy user agents that do not support the
    <code>srcdoc</code> attribute.
  </p>

  <hr />

  When an <{iframe}> element is <a for="document">inserted into a document</a> that has a
  <a>browsing context</a>, the user agent must create a <a>nested browsing context</a>, and
  then <a>process the <code>iframe</code> attributes</a> for the "first time".

  When an <{iframe}> element is <a for="document">removed from a document</a>, the user agent
  must <a>discard</a> the <a>nested browsing context</a>, if any.

  <p class="note">
    This happens without any <code>unload</code> events firing
    (the <a>nested browsing context</a> and its {{Document}} are <em><a>discarded</a></em>,
    not <em><a>unloaded</a></em>).
  </p>

  Whenever an <{iframe}> element with a <a>nested browsing context</a> has its
  <code>srcdoc</code> attribute set, changed, or removed, the user agent
  must <a>process the <code>iframe</code> attributes</a>.

  Similarly, whenever an <{iframe}> element with a <a>nested browsing context</a>
  but with no <code>srcdoc</code> attribute specified has its <code>src</code> attribute set, changed, or removed, the user agent must
  <a>process the <code>iframe</code> attributes</a>.

  When the user agent is to <dfn lt="reprocess the iframe attributes|process the iframe attributes">process the <code>iframe</code> attributes</dfn>, it must run
  the first appropriate steps from the following list:

  <dl class="switch">

    <dt>If the <code>srcdoc</code> attribute is specified</dt>

    <dd>

    <a>Navigate</a> the element's <a>child browsing context</a> to a new <a>response</a> whose
    <a>url list</a> consists of <a scheme>about:srcdoc</a>, [=response/header list=]
    consists of <code>Content-Type</code>/<code>[[#text-html|text/html]]</code>,
    [=response/body=] is the value of the attribute, [=response/CSP list=] is the
    <a for="document">CSP list</a> of the <{iframe}> element's <a>node document</a>, and
    [=response/HTTPS state=] is the <a for="document">HTTPS state</a> of the <{iframe}>
    element's <a>node document</a>.

    The resulting {{Document}} must be considered
    <a>an `iframe` `srcdoc` document</a>.

    </dd>

    <dt>Otherwise, if the element has no <code>src</code> attribute
    specified, and the user agent is processing the <code>iframe</code>'s attributes for the "first
    time"</dt>

    <dd>

    <a>Queue a task</a> to run the <a>iframe load event steps</a>.

    </dd>

    <dt>Otherwise</dt>

    <dd>Run the <a>otherwise steps for iframe or frame elements</a>.</dd>

  </dl>

  The <dfn>otherwise steps for iframe or frame elements</dfn> are as follows:

  1: If the element has no <code data-x="attr-iframe-src">src</code> attribute specified, or its
      value is the empty string, let <var>url</var> be the [=url/URL=] "<code>about:blank</code>".

      Otherwise, <a>parse</a> the value of the <code>src</code> attribute, relative to the
      element's <a>node document</a>.

      If that is not successful, then let <var>url</var> be the [=url/URL=]
      "<code>about:blank</code>". Otherwise, let <var>url</var> be the <a>resulting URL record</a>.
  2. If there exists an <a>ancestor browsing context</a> whose <a>active document</a>'s
      [=Document/URL=], ignoring <a for="url">fragments</a>, is equal to <var>url</var>,
      then abort these steps.
  3. Let <var>resource</var> be a new [=request=] whose <a for="request">url</a> is
      <var>URL</var> and whose [=referrer policy=] is the current state of the
      element's <code>referrerpolicy</code> content attribute.
  4. <a>Navigate</a> the element's <a>child browsing context</a> to <var>resource</var>.

  Furthermore, if the <a>active document</a> of the element's <a>child browsing context</a> before
  such a <a>navigation</a> was not <a>completely loaded</a> at the time of the new
  <a>navigation</a>, then the <a>navigation</a> must be completed with <a>replacement enabled</a>.

  Similarly, if the <a>child browsing context</a>'s <a>session history</a> contained only one
  {{Document}} when the <a>process the <code>iframe</code> attributes</a> algorithm was invoked,
  and that was the <code>about:blank</code> {{Document}} created when the
  <a>child browsing context</a> was created, then any <a>navigation</a> required of the
  user agent in that algorithm must be completed with <a>replacement enabled</a>.

  When a {{Document}} in an <code>iframe</code> is marked as <a>completely loaded</a>, the user
  agent must run the <a>iframe load event steps</a>.

  <p class="note">
    A <code>load</code> event is also fired at the <{iframe}> element when it is created if no
    other data is loaded in it.
  </p>

  Each {{Document}} has an <dfn>iframe load in progress</dfn> flag and a
  <dfn>mute iframe load</dfn> flag. When a {{Document}} is created, these flags must be unset
  for that {{Document}}.

  The <dfn>iframe load event steps</dfn> are as follows:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>child document</var> be the <a>active document</a> of the
    <{iframe}> element's <a>nested browsing context</a>.</li>

    <li>If <var>child document</var> has its <a>mute iframe load</a> flag set,
    abort these steps.</li>

    <li>Set <var>child document</var>'s <a>iframe load in progress</a> flag.</li>

    <li><a>Fire a simple event</a> named <code>load</code> at the <{iframe}> element.</li>

    <li>Unset <var>child document</var>'s <a>iframe load in progress</a> flag.</li>

  </ol>

  <p class="warning">
    This, in conjunction with scripting, can be used to probe the URL space of the
    local network's HTTP servers. User agents may implement <a>cross-origin</a>
    access control policies that are stricter than those described above to mitigate this attack,
    but unfortunately such policies are typically not compatible with existing Web content.
  </p>

  When the <code>iframe</code>'s <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a> is
  not [=ready for post-load tasks=], and when anything in the <code>iframe</code> is
  <a>delaying the load event</a> of the <code>iframe</code>'s
  <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a>, and when the <code>iframe</code>'s
  <a>browsing context</a> is in the <a>delaying <code>load</code> events mode</a>,
  the <code>iframe</code> must <a>delay the load event</a> of its document.

  <p class="note">
    If, during the handling of the <code>load</code> event, the <a>browsing context</a> in the
    <code>iframe</code> is again <a>navigated</a>, that will further <a>delay the load event</a>.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    If, when the element is created, the <code>srcdoc</code> attribute is not set, and the
    <code>src</code> attribute is either also not set or set but its value cannot be
    <a>parsed</a>, the browsing context will remain at the initial <code>about:blank</code> page.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    If the user <a>navigates</a> away from this page, the <code>iframe</code>'s corresponding
    <code>WindowProxy</code> object will proxy new <code>Window</code> objects for new
    {{Document}} objects, but the <code>src</code> attribute will not change.
  </p>

  <hr />

  The <dfn element-attr for="iframe"><code>name</code></dfn> attribute, if present, must be a
  <a>valid browsing context name</a>. The given value is used to name the
  <a>nested browsing context</a>.
  When the browsing context is created, if the attribute is present, the
  <a>browsing context name</a> must be set to the value of this attribute;
  otherwise, the <a>browsing context name</a> must be set to the empty string.

  Whenever the <code>name</code> attribute is set, the nested <a>browsing context</a>'s
  <a lt="browsing context name">name</a> must be changed to the new value. If the attribute
  is removed, the <a>browsing context name</a> must be set to the empty string.

  <hr />

  The <dfn element-attr for="iframe"><code>sandbox</code></dfn> attribute, when specified,
  enables a set of extra restrictions on any content hosted by the <{iframe}>. Its value
  must be an <a>unordered set of unique space-separated tokens</a> that are <a>ASCII
  case-insensitive</a>. The allowed values are <code>allow-forms</code>, <code>allow-pointer-lock</code>, <code>allow-popups</code>, <code>allow-presentation</code>, <code>allow-same-origin</code>, <code>allow-scripts</code>, and <code>allow-top-navigation</code>.

  When the attribute is set, the content is treated as being from a unique [=concept/origin=],
  forms, scripts, and various potentially annoying APIs are disabled, links are prevented from
  targeting other <a>browsing contexts</a>, and plugins are secured.
  The <code>allow-same-origin</code> keyword causes
  the content to be treated as being from its real origin instead of forcing it into a unique
  origin; the <code>allow-top-navigation</code>
  keyword allows the content to <a>navigate</a> its <a>top-level browsing context</a>;
  and the <code>allow-forms</code>, <code>allow-pointer-lock</code>, <code>allow-popups</code>,
  <code>allow-presentation</code> and <code>allow-scripts</code> keywords re-enable forms, the
  pointer lock API, popups, the presentation API, and scripts respectively. [[!POINTERLOCK]] [[!PRESENTATION-API]]

  <p class="warning">Setting both the <code>allow-scripts</code> and <code>allow-same-origin</code> keywords together when the
  embedded page has the <a>same origin</a> as the page containing the <code>iframe</code>
  allows the embedded page to simply remove the <{iframe/sandbox}>
  attribute and then reload itself, effectively breaking out of the sandbox altogether.</p>

  <p class="warning">These flags only take effect when the <a>nested browsing context</a> of
  the <code>iframe</code> is <a>navigated</a>. Removing them, or removing the
  entire <{iframe/sandbox}> attribute, has no effect on an
  already-loaded page.</p>

  <p class="warning">Potentially hostile files should not be served from the same server as the file
  containing the <{iframe}> element. Sandboxing hostile content is of minimal help if an
  attacker can convince the user to just visit the hostile content directly, rather than in the
  <{iframe}>. To limit the damage that can be caused by hostile HTML content, it should be
  served from a separate dedicated domain. Using a different domain ensures that scripts in the
  files are unable to attack the site, even if the user is tricked into visiting those pages
  directly, without the protection of the <{iframe/sandbox}>
  attribute.</p>

  When an <{iframe}> element with a <{iframe/sandbox}>
  attribute has its <a>nested browsing context</a> created (before the initial
  <code>about:blank</code> {{Document}} is created), and when an <code>iframe</code>
  element's <{iframe/sandbox}> attribute is set or changed while it
  has a <a>nested browsing context</a>, the user agent must <a>parse the sandboxing directive</a> using the attribute's value as the <var>input</var>, the <{iframe}> element's <a>nested browsing context</a>'s
  <span><{iframe}> sandboxing flag set</span> as the output, and, if the
  <code>iframe</code> has an <code>allowfullscreen</code>
  attribute, the <var>allow fullscreen flag</var>.

  When an <{iframe}> element's <{iframe/sandbox}>
  attribute is removed while it has a <a>nested browsing context</a>, the user agent must
  empty the <{iframe}> element's <a>nested browsing context</a>'s
  <span><{iframe}> sandboxing flag set</span> as the output.

  <div class="example">
    In this example, some completely-unknown, potentially hostile, user-provided HTML content is
    embedded in a page. Because it is served from a separate domain, it is affected by all the normal
    cross-site restrictions. In addition, the embedded page has scripting disabled, plugins disabled,
    forms disabled, and it cannot navigate any frames or windows other than itself (or any frames or
    windows it itself embeds).

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <p>We're not scared of you! Here is your content, unedited:</p>
      <iframe title="Example iframe" sandbox src="https://usercontent.example.net/getusercontent.cgi?id=12345"></iframe>
    </xmp>

    <p class="warning">
      It is important to use a separate domain so that if the attacker convinces the
      user to visit that page directly, the page doesn't run in the context of the site's origin,
      which would make the user vulnerable to any attack found in the page.
    </p>

  </div>

  <div class="example">
    In this example, a gadget from another site is embedded. The gadget has scripting and forms
    enabled, and the origin sandbox restrictions are lifted, allowing the gadget to communicate
    with its originating server. The sandbox is still useful, however, as it disables plugins
    and popups, thus reducing the risk of the user being exposed to malware and other annoyances.

  </div>

  <div class="example">
    Suppose a file A contained the following fragment:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <iframe title="Example iframe" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-forms" src="B"></iframe>
    </xmp>

    Suppose that file B contained an iframe also:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <iframe title="Example iframe" sandbox="allow-scripts" src="C"></iframe>
    </xmp>

    Further, suppose that file C contained a link:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <a href="D">Link</a>
    </xmp>

    For this example, suppose all the files were served as <code>[[#text-html|text/html]]</code>.

    Page C in this scenario has all the sandboxing flags set. Scripts are disabled, because the
    <code>iframe</code> in A has scripts disabled, and this overrides the
    <code>allow-scripts</code> keyword set on the <code>iframe</code> in B. Forms are also
    disabled, because the inner <code>iframe</code> (in B) does not have the
    <code>allow-forms</code> keyword set.

    Suppose now that a script in A removes all the <{iframe/sandbox}> attributes in A and B.
    This would change nothing immediately. If the user clicked the link in C, loading page D into
    the <code>iframe</code> in B, page D would now act as if the <code>iframe</code> in B had the
    <code>allow-same-origin</code> and <code>allow-forms</code> keywords set, because that was the
    state of the <a>nested browsing context</a> in the <code>iframe</code> in A when page B was
    loaded.

    Generally speaking, dynamically removing or changing the <{iframe/sandbox}> attribute is
    ill-advised, because it can make it quite hard to reason about what will be allowed and
    what will not.

  The <{embed}> element provides an integration point for an external (typically
  non-HTML) application or interactive content.

  The <dfn element-attr for="embed"><code>src</code></dfn> attribute gives the address of the
  resource being embedded. The attribute, if present, must contain a <a>valid non-empty URL
  potentially surrounded by spaces</a>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="embed"><code>type</code></dfn> attribute, if present, gives the
  <a>MIME type</a> by which the plugin to instantiate is selected. The value must be a
  <a>valid mime type</a>. If both the <code>type</code> attribute and
  the <code>src</code> attribute are present, then the <code>type</code> attribute must specify the same type as the <a>explicit Content-Type metadata</a> of the resource given by the <code>src</code> attribute.

  While any of the following conditions are occurring, any <a>plugin</a> instantiated for
  the element must be removed, and the <{embed}> element <a>represents</a>
  nothing:

  <ul class="brief">

    <li>The element has neither a <code>src</code> attribute nor a <code>type</code> attribute.</li>

    <li>The element has a <a>media element</a> ancestor.</li>

    <li>The element has an ancestor <{object}> element that is <em>not</em> showing its
    <a>fallback content</a>.</li>

  </ul>

  An <{embed}> element is said to be <dfn>potentially
  active</dfn> when the following conditions are all met simultaneously:

  <ul class="brief">

    <li>The element is <a>in a <code>Document</code></a> or was <a>in a <code>Document</code></a> the last time the <a>event loop</a>
    reached step 1.</li>

    <li>The element's <a>node document</a> is <a>fully active</a>.</li>

    <li>The element has either a <code>src</code> attribute set or a <code>type</code> attribute set (or both).</li>

    <li>The element's <code>src</code> attribute is either absent or its value
    is not the empty string.</li>

    <li>The element is not a descendant of a <a>media element</a>.</li>

    <li>The element is not a descendant of an <{object}> element that is not showing its
    <a>fallback content</a>.</li>

    <li>The element is <a>being rendered</a>, or was <a>being rendered</a> the last time
    the <a>event loop</a> reached step 1.</li>

  </ul>

  Whenever an <{embed}> element that was not <a>potentially active</a> becomes <a>potentially active</a>, and whenever a <a>potentially active</a> <{embed}> element that is
  remaining <a>potentially active</a> and has its <code>src</code> attribute set, changed, or removed or its <code>type</code> attribute set, changed, or removed, the user agent must
  <a>queue a task</a> using the <dfn>embed task source</dfn> to run <a>the
  <code>embed</code> element setup steps</a>.

  <dfn>The <{embed}> element setup steps</dfn> are as follows:

  <ol>

    <li>If another <a>task</a> has since been queued to run <a>the
    <code>embed</code> element setup steps</a> for this element, then abort these steps.</li>

    <li>

    <dl class="switch">

      <dt>If the element has a <code>src</code> attribute set</dt>

      <dd>

      The user agent must <a>parse</a> the value of the element's
      <code>src</code> attribute, relative to the element. If that is
      successful, the user agent should run these steps:

      <ol>

        <li>Let <var>request</var> be a new <a>request</a> whose
        [=url/URL=] is the <a>resulting URL string</a>,
        <a>client</a> is the element's <a>node
        document</a>'s <code>Window</code> object's <a>environment settings object</a>,
        <a>destination</a> is "<code>unknown</code>", <a>omit-<code>Origin</code>-header flag</a> is set if the
        element doesn't have a <a>browsing context scope origin</a>, <a>credentials mode</a> is "<code>include</code>", and whose <a>use-URL-credentials flag</a> is set.</li>

        <li><a>Fetch</a> <var>request</var>.</li>
      </ol>

      The <a>task</a> that is <a>queued</a> by the <a>networking task source</a> once the
      resource has been fetched must run the following steps:

      <ol>

        <li>If another <a>task</a> has since been queued to run
        <a>the <code>embed</code> element setup steps</a> for this element, then abort these
        steps.</li>

        <li>

        Determine the <dfn>type of the content</dfn> being embedded, as
        follows (stopping at the first substep that determines the type):

        <ol>

          <li>If the element has a <code>type</code> attribute, and that
attribute's value is a type that a <a>plugin</a> supports, then the value of the
          <code>type</code> attribute is the content's type.</li>

          <li>

          Otherwise, if applying the <a>URL parser</a> algorithm to the [=url/URL=] of
          the specified resource (after any redirects) results in a <a>URL record</a> whose
          <a>path</a> component matches a pattern that a
          <a>plugin</a> supports, then the content's type is the type that the plugin can handle.

          <p class="example">For example, a plugin might say that it can handle resources with <a>path</a> components that end with the four character string
          "<code>.swf</code>".</p>

          </li>

          <li>Otherwise, if the specified resource has <a>explicit
          Content-Type metadata</a>, then that is the content's type.</li>

          <li>Otherwise, the content has no <a for="request">type</a> and there
          can be no appropriate <a>plugin</a> for it.</li>

        </ol>

        </li>

        <li>

        If the previous step determined that the content's type is <code>image/svg+xml</code>, then run the following substeps:

        <ol>

          <li>If the <{embed}> element is not associated with a <a>nested browsing context</a>, associate the element with a newly created <a>nested browsing context</a>, and, if the element has a <code>name</code> attribute, set the <a>browsing context name</a> of the element's <a>nested browsing context</a> to the value of this attribute.

          </li><li><a>Navigate</a> the <a>nested browsing context</a> to
          the fetched resource, with <a>replacement enabled</a>, and with the
          <{embed}> element's <a>node document</a>'s <a>browsing context</a> as the <a>source
          browsing context</a>. (The <code>src</code> attribute of the
          <{embed}> element doesn't get updated if the browsing context gets further
          navigated to other locations.)</li>

          <li>The <{embed}> element now <a>represents</a> its associated
          <a>nested browsing context</a>.</li>

        </ol>

        </li>

        <li>

        Otherwise, find and instantiate an appropriate <a>plugin</a> based on the content's type, and hand that <a>plugin</a> the
        content of the resource, replacing any previously instantiated plugin for the element. The
        <{embed}> element now represents this <a>plugin</a> instance.

        </li>

        <li>Once the resource or plugin has completely loaded, <a>queue a task</a> to
        <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>load</code> at the
        element.</li>

      </ol>

      Whether the resource is fetched successfully or not (e.g., whether the response status was
      an <a>ok status</a>) must be ignored when determining the content's type and when handing
      the resource to the plugin.

      <p class="note">
        This allows servers to return data for plugins even with error responses (e.g.,
        HTTP 500 Internal Server Error codes can still contain plugin data).
      </p>

      Fetching the resource must <a>delay the load event</a> of the element's <a>node document</a>.

      </dd>

      <dt>If the element has no <code>src</code> attribute set</dt>

      <dd>

      The user agent should find and instantiate an appropriate <a>plugin</a> based on the
      value of the <code>type</code> attribute. The <code>embed</code>
      element now represents this <a>plugin</a> instance.

      Once the plugin is completely loaded, <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple
      event</a> named <code>load</code> at the element.

      </dd>

    </dl>

    </li>

  </ol>

  The <{embed}> element has no <a>fallback content</a>. If the user agent can't
  find a suitable plugin when attempting to find and instantiate one for the algorithm above, then
  the user agent must use a default plugin. This default could be as simple as saying "Unsupported
  Format".

  Whenever an <{embed}> element that was <a>potentially
  active</a> stops being <a>potentially active</a>, any
  <a>plugin</a> that had been instantiated for that element must be unloaded.

  When a <a>plugin</a> is to be instantiated but it cannot be <a>secured</a> and the <a>sandboxed plugins browsing context
  flag</a> is set on the <{embed}> element's <a>node document</a>'s <a>active
  sandboxing flag set</a>, then the user agent must not instantiate the <a>plugin</a>, and
  must instead render the <{embed}> element in a manner that conveys that the
  <a>plugin</a> was disabled. The user agent may offer the user the option to override the
  sandbox and instantiate the <a>plugin</a> anyway; if the user invokes such an option, the
  user agent must act as if the conditions above did not apply for the purposes of this element.

  <p class="warning">Plugins that cannot be <a>secured</a> are
  disabled in sandboxed browsing contexts because they might not honor the restrictions imposed by
  the sandbox (e.g., they might allow scripting even when scripting in the sandbox is disabled). User
  agents should convey the danger of overriding the sandbox to the user if an option to do so is
  provided.</p>

  When an <{embed}> element represents a <a>nested browsing context</a>: if the
  <{embed}> element's <a>nested browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a>
  is not [=ready for post-load tasks=], and when anything is <a>delaying the load event</a> of the <{embed}> element's <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a>, and when the <{embed}> element's
  <a>browsing context</a> is in the <a>delaying <code>load</code>
  events mode</a>, the <code>embed</code> must <a>delay the load event</a> of its
  document.

  The <a>task source</a> for the <a>tasks</a> mentioned in this
  section is the <a>DOM manipulation task source</a>.

  Any namespace-less attribute other than <code>name</code>, <code>align</code>, <code>hspace</code>, and <code>vspace</code> may be
  specified on the <{embed}> element, so long as its name is <a>XML-compatible</a>
  and contains no <a>uppercase ASCII letters</a>. These attributes are then passed as
  parameters to the <a>plugin</a>.

  <p class="note">
    All attributes in <a>HTML documents</a> get lowercased automatically, so the
  restriction on uppercase letters doesn't affect such documents.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    The four exceptions are to exclude legacy attributes that have side-effects beyond
  just sending parameters to the <a>plugin</a>.
  </p>

  The user agent should pass the names and values of all the attributes of the <code>embed</code>
  element that have no namespace to the <a>plugin</a> used, when one is instantiated.

  The <code>HTMLEmbedElement</code> object representing the element must expose the scriptable
  interface of the <a>plugin</a> instantiated for the <{embed}> element, if any. At a
  minimum, this interface must implement the <dfn for="embed">legacy caller
  operation</dfn>. (It is suggested that the default behavior of this legacy caller operation, e.g.,
  the behavior of the default plugin's legacy caller operation, be to throw a
  {{NotSupportedError}} exception.)

  The <{embed}> element supports <a>dimension attributes</a>.

  The IDL attributes <dfn attribute for="HTMLEmbedElement"><code>src</code></dfn> and
  <dfn attribute for="HTMLEmbedElement"><code>type</code></dfn> each must <a>reflect</a> the
  respective content attributes of the same name.

  <div class="example">
    Here's a way to embed a resource that requires a proprietary plugin, like Flash:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <embed src="catgame.swf">
    </xmp>

    If the user does not have the plugin (for example if the plugin vendor doesn't support the
    user's platform), then the user will be unable to use the resource.

    To pass the plugin a parameter "quality" with the value "high", an attribute can be
    specified:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <embed src="catgame.swf" quality="high">
    </xmp>

    This would be equivalent to the following, when using an <{object}> element
    instead:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <object data="catgame.swf">
        <param name="quality" value="high">

        Depending on the type of content instantiated by the <{object}> element, the node also
        supports other interfaces.

  </dl>

  The <{object}> element can represent an external resource, which, depending on the
  type of the resource, will either be treated as an image, as a <a>nested browsing context</a>, or as an external resource to be processed by a <a>plugin</a>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="object"><code>data</code></dfn> attribute, if present, specifies the
  address of the resource. If present, the attribute must be a
  <a>valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces</a>.

  <p class="warning">Authors who reference resources from other <a for="concept">origins</a>
  that they do not trust are urged to use the <code>typemustmatch</code> attribute defined below. Without that
  attribute, it is possible in certain cases for an attacker on the remote host to use the plugin
  mechanism to run arbitrary scripts, even if the author has used features such as the Flash
  "allowScriptAccess" parameter.</p>

  The <dfn element-attr for="object"><code>type</code></dfn> attribute, if present, specifies the
  type of the resource. If present, the attribute must be a <a>valid mime type</a>.

  At least one of either the <code>data</code> attribute or the <code>type</code> attribute must be present.

  The <dfn element-attr for="object"><code>typemustmatch</code></dfn> attribute is a
  <a>boolean attribute</a> whose presence indicates that the resource specified by the <code>data</code> attribute is only to be used if the value of the <code>type</code> attribute and the <a>Content-Type</a> of the
  aforementioned resource match.

  The <code>typemustmatch</code> attribute must not be
  specified unless both the <code>data</code> attribute and the <code>type</code> attribute are present.

  The <dfn element-attr for="object"><code>name</code></dfn> attribute, if present, must be a
  <a>valid browsing context name</a>. The value is used to name the <a>nested browsing context</a> created for the object, if applicable.

  <div class="example">
    This allows links to use the object's <a>browsing context</a> as a target:

    Clicking the link "Check out the new icon" in the example below would cause the new.svg to
    be loaded in place of the original old.svg.

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <p>
        <object data="old.svg" name="svgobject">A boring icon</object>
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="new.svg" target="svgobject">Check out the new icon</a>!
      </p>
    </xmp>

    <p class="warning">
      If a <a>nested browsing context</a> is not created, e.g. for security reasons or due to
      incorrect implementation of the <{object/name3}> attribute, the <code>target</code> attribute
      in this example will instead <a>create a new browsing context</a> - typically a new tab -
      whose <a>browsing context name</a> is the attribute's value, and the resource that the link
      references will be loaded there.

  <dfn lt="should be used"></dfn>When the algorithm above instantiates a <a>plugin</a>, the user agent
  should pass to the <a>plugin</a> used the names and values of all the attributes on the

  <a>plugin</a> is not a nested <a>browsing context</a>.

  Plugins are considered sandboxed for the purpose of an

  the <{object}> element's <a>node document</a>'s <a>active sandboxing flag
  set</a>.

  Due to the algorithm above, the contents of <{object}> elements act as
  <a>fallback content</a>, used only when referenced resources can't be shown (e.g., because it
  returned a 404 error). This allows multiple <{object}> elements to be nested inside each other,
  targeting multiple user agents with different capabilities, with the user agent picking the first
  one it supports.

  events mode</a>, the <code>object</code> must <a>delay the load event</a> of its document.

  The <a>task source</a> for the <a>tasks</a> mentioned in this
  section is the <a>DOM manipulation task source</a>.

  Whenever the <code>name</code> attribute is set, if the
  <{object}> element has a nested <a>browsing context</a>, its
  <a lt="browsing context name">name</a> must be changed to the new value. If the attribute is
  removed, if the <{object}> element has a <a>browsing context</a>, the
  <a>browsing context name</a> must be set to the empty string.

  The <{param}> element defines parameters for plugins invoked by <code>object</code>
  elements. It does not <a>represent</a> anything on its own.

  The <dfn element-attr for="param"><code>name</code></dfn> attribute gives the name of the
  parameter.

  The <dfn element-attr for="param"><code>value</code></dfn> attribute gives the value of the
  parameter.

  Both attributes must be present. They may have any value.

  If both attributes are present, and if the parent element of the <code>param</code> is an
  <{object}> element, then the element defines a <dfn>parameter</dfn> with the given name-value pair.

  A <{video}> element is used for playing videos or movies, and audio files with captions.

  Content may be provided inside the <{video}> element. User agents
  should not show this content to the user; it is intended for older Web browsers which do
  not support <{video}>, so that legacy video plugins can be tried, or to show text to the
  users of these older browsers informing them of how to access the video contents.

  <p class="note">
    In particular, this content is not intended to address accessibility concerns. To make video
    content accessible to people with disabilities, a variety of features are available.
    Captions and sign language tracks can be embedded in the video stream, or as external files
    using the <{track}> element. Audio descriptions can be provided, either as a separate track
    embedded in the video stream, or by referencing a <a>WebVTT file</a> with the <{track}>
    element that the user agent can present as synthesized speech. WebVTT can also be used to
    provide chapter titles. For users who would rather not use a media element at all, transcripts
    or other textual alternatives can be provided by simply linking to them in the prose near the
    <{video}> element. [[WEBVTT]]
  </p>

  The <{video}> element is a <a>media element</a> whose <a>media data</a> is ostensibly video
  data, possibly with associated audio data.

  Because the <{video}> element is necessary to support accessibility for audio content,
  user agents should support playback of the same set of audio formats and container formats
  in the <{video}> element that they support for the <{audio}> element.

  The <code>src</code>, <code>preload</code>, <code>autoplay</code>, <code>loop</code>,
  <code>muted</code>, and <{video/controls}> attributes are the attributes common to all
  media elements.

  The <dfn element-attr for="video"><code>poster</code></dfn> content attribute gives the address of an
  image file that the user agent can show while no video data is available. The attribute, if
  present, must contain a <a>valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces</a>.

  If the specified resource is to be used, then, when the element is created or when the <code>poster</code> attribute is set, changed, or removed, the user agent must
  run the following steps to determine the element's <dfn>poster frame</dfn> (regardless of the
  value of the element's <a>show poster flag</a>):

  <ol>

    <li>If there is an existing instance of this algorithm running for this <code>video</code>
    element, abort that instance of this algorithm without changing the <a>poster
    frame</a>.</li>

    <li>If the <code>poster</code> attribute's value is the empty string
    or if the attribute is absent, then there is no <a>poster frame</a>; abort these
    steps.</li>

    <li><a>Parse</a> the <code>poster</code> attribute's value relative to the element. If this
    fails, then there is no <a>poster frame</a>; abort these steps.</li>

    <li>Let <var>request</var> be a new <a>request</a> whose
    [=url/URL=] is the <a>resulting URL string</a>,
    <a>client</a> is the element's <a>node document</a>'s
    <code>Window</code> object's <a>environment settings object</a>, <a for="request">type</a> is "<code>image</code>", <a>destination</a> is "<code>subresource</code>",
    <a>credentials mode</a> is "<code>include</code>", and whose <a>use-URL-credentials flag</a> is set.

    </li><li><a>Fetch</a> <var>request</var>. This must
    <a>delay the load event</a> of the element's <a>node document</a>.</li>

    <li>If an image is thus obtained, the <a>poster frame</a> is that image. Otherwise,
    there is no <a>poster frame</a>.</li>

  </ol>

  <p class="note">
    The image given by the <code>poster</code> attribute, the <i>poster frame</i>, is intended to
    be a representative frame of the video (typically one of the first non-blank frames) that
    gives the user an idea of what the video is like.
  </p>

  A <{video}> element represents what is given for the first matching condition in the list below:

  <dl class="switch">

    <dt>When no video data is available (the element's <code>readyState</code> attribute is
    either <code>HAVE_NOTHING</code>, or <code>HAVE_METADATA</code> but no video data has yet been
    obtained at all, or the element's <code>readyState</code> attribute is any
    subsequent value but the <a>media resource</a> does not have a video channel)</dt>

    <dd>The <{video}> element <a>represents</a> its <a>poster frame</a>, if any,
    or else transparent black with no <a>intrinsic dimensions</a>.</dd>

    <dt>When the <{video}> element is {{HTMLMediaElement/paused}}, the

    <dd>The <{video}> element <a>represents</a> its <a>poster frame</a>, if any,
    or else the first frame of the video.</dd>

    <dt>When the <{video}> element is {{HTMLMediaElement/paused}}, and the
    frame of video corresponding to the <a>current playback
    position</a> is not available (e.g., because the video is seeking or buffering)</dt>

    <dt>When the <{video}> element is neither <a>potentially playing</a> nor
    {{HTMLMediaElement/paused}} (e.g., when seeking or stalled)</dt>

    <dd>The <{video}> element <a>represents</a> the last frame of the video to have
    been rendered.</dd>

    <dt>When the <{video}> element is {{HTMLMediaElement/paused}}</dt>

    <dd>The <{video}> element <a>represents</a> the frame of video corresponding to
    the <a>current playback position</a>.</dd>

    <dt>Otherwise (the <{video}> element has a video channel and is <a>potentially
    playing</a>)</dt>

    <dd>The <{video}> element <a>represents</a> the frame of video at the continuously
    increasing <a lt="current position">"current" position</a>. When the
    <a>current playback position</a> changes such that the last frame rendered is no longer the
    frame corresponding to the <a>current playback position</a> in the video, the new frame
    must be rendered.</dd>

  </dl>

  Frames of video must be obtained from the video track that was <a>selected</a> when the
  <a>event loop</a> last reached step 1.

  <p class="note">
    Which frame in a video stream corresponds to a particular playback position is
    defined by the video stream's format.
  </p>

  The <{video}> element also <a>represents</a> any <a>text track cues</a> whose
  <a>text track cue active flag</a> is set and whose
  <a>text track</a> is in the <a mode for="track">showing</a> mode, and any
  audio from the <a>media resource</a>, at the <a>current playback position</a>.

  Any audio associated with the <a>media resource</a> must, if played, be played
  synchronized with the <a>current playback position</a>, at the element's <a>effective
  media volume</a>. The user agent must play the audio from audio tracks that were enabled when the <a>event loop</a> last reached step 1.

  In addition to the above, the user agent may provide messages to the user (such as "buffering",
  "no video loaded", "error", or more detailed information) by overlaying text or icons on the
  video or other areas of the element's playback area, or in another appropriate manner.

  User agents that cannot render the video may instead make the element <a>represent</a> a link
  to an external video playback utility or to the video data itself.

  When a <{video}> element's <a>media resource</a> has a video channel, the
  element provides a <a>paint source</a> whose width is the <a>media resource</a>'s
  <a for="video">intrinsic width</a>, whose height is the
  <a>media resource</a>'s <a for="video">intrinsic height</a>, and whose appearance is
  the frame of video corresponding to the <a>current playback position</a>, if that is available, or else
  (e.g., when the video is seeking or buffering) its previous appearance, if any, or else (e.g.,
  because the video is still loading the first frame) blackness.

    <dt><var>video</var> . <code>videoWidth</code></dt>
    <dt><var>video</var> . <code>videoHeight</code></dt>

    <dd>

    These attributes return the intrinsic dimensions of the video,
    or zero if the dimensions are not known.

    </dd>

  </dl>

  The <dfn for='video'>intrinsic width</dfn> and <dfn for='video'>intrinsic height</dfn> of the <a>media resource</a>
  are the dimensions of the resource in CSS pixels after taking into account the resource's
  dimensions, aspect ratio, clean aperture, resolution, and so forth, as defined for the format used
  by the resource. If an anamorphic format does not define how to apply the aspect ratio to the
  video data's dimensions to obtain the "correct" dimensions, then the user agent must apply the
  ratio by increasing one dimension and leaving the other unchanged.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLVideoElement"><code>videoWidth</code></dfn> IDL attribute must return
  the <a for='video'>intrinsic width</a> of the video in CSS pixels.
  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLVideoElement"><code>videoHeight</code></dfn> IDL attribute must
  return the <a for='video'>intrinsic height</a> of the video in CSS
  pixels. If the element's <code>readyState</code> attribute is <code>HAVE_NOTHING</code>,
  then the attributes must return 0.

  Whenever the <a for='video'>intrinsic width</a> or <a for='video'>intrinsic height</a> of the
  video changes (including, for example, because the selected video track was changed), if the
  element's <code>readyState</code> attribute is not <code>HAVE_NOTHING</code>, the user agent must
  <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>resize</code> at the
  <a>media element</a>.

  The <{video}> element supports <a>dimension attributes</a>.

  In the absence of style rules to the contrary, video content should be rendered inside the
  element's playback area such that the video content is shown centered in the playback area at the
  largest possible size that fits completely within it, with the video content's aspect ratio being
  preserved. Thus, if the aspect ratio of the playback area does not match the aspect ratio of the
  video, the video will be shown letterboxed or pillarboxed. Areas of the element's playback area
  that do not contain the video represent nothing.

  <p class="note">
    In user agents that implement CSS, the above requirement can be implemented by
    using the style rule suggested in [[#rendering]].
  </p>

  The <a for="css">intrinsic width</a> of a <{video}> element's playback area is the
  <a for="css">intrinsic width</a> of the <a>poster frame</a>, if that is available and the
  element currently <a>represents</a> its poster frame; otherwise, it is the
  <a for="video">intrinsic width</a> of the video resource, if that is
  available; otherwise the <a for="css">intrinsic width</a> is missing.

  The <a for="css">intrinsic height</a> of a <{video}> element's playback area is the
  <a for="css">intrinsic height</a> of the <a>poster frame</a>, if that is available and the
  element currently <a>represents</a> its poster frame; otherwise it is the
  <a for="video">intrinsic height</a> of the video resource, if that is
  available; otherwise the <a for="css">intrinsic height</a> is missing.

  The <a>default object size</a> is a width of 300 CSS pixels and a height of 150 CSS
  pixels. [[!CSS3-IMAGES]]

  <hr />

  User agents should provide controls to enable or disable the display of closed captions, audio
  description tracks, and other additional data associated with the video stream, though such
  features should, again, not interfere with the page's normal rendering.

  User agents may allow users to view the video content in manners more suitable to the user
  (e.g., fullscreen or in an independent resizable window). Captions, subtitles or other additional
  visual tracks should remain available and visible when enabled. As for the other user interface
  features, controls to enable this should not interfere with the page's normal rendering unless
  the user agent is exposing a user interface. As for the other user interface features, controls
  to enable this should not interfere with the page's normal rendering unless the user agent is
  <a>exposing a user interface</a>. In such an independent context, however, user agents may make
  full user interfaces visible e.g., play, pause, seeking, and volume controls even if the
  <{mediaelements/controls}> attribute is absent.

  User agents may allow video playback to affect system features that could interfere with the
  user's experience; for example, user agents could disable screensavers while video playback is in
  progress.

  <hr />

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLVideoElement"><code>poster</code></dfn> IDL attribute must

  An <{audio}> element <a>represents</a> a sound or audio stream.

  Content may be provided inside the <{audio}> element. User agents
  should not show this content to the user; it is intended for older Web browsers which do
  not support <{audio}>, so that legacy audio plugins can be tried, or to show text to the
  users of these older browsers informing them of how to access the audio contents.

  <div class="example">
    In this example, a browser which does not support inline audio can present a download link to
    the user.

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <audio src="music.ogg" controls>
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
        <a href="music.ogg">Download the music file instead</a>.
      </audio>
    </xmp>
  </div>

  <p class="note">
    In particular, this content is not intended to address accessibility concerns. To
    make audio content accessible to people with hearing, cognitive or other
    disabilities, a variety of features are available. If captions or a sign language video are
    available, the <{video}> element can be used instead of the <{audio}> element to
    play the audio, allowing users to enable the visual alternatives. Chapter titles can be
    provided to aid navigation, using the <{track}> element and a <a>WebVTT file</a>. And,
    naturally, transcripts or other textual alternatives can be provided by simply linking to
    them in the prose near the <{audio}> element. [[WEBVTT]]
  </p>

  The <{audio}> element is a <a>media element</a> whose <a>media data</a> is ostensibly audio data.

  The <code>src</code>, <code>preload</code>,
  <code>autoplay</code>, <code>loop</code>, <code>muted</code>, and <{audio/controls}>
  attributes are the attributes common to all media elements.

  When an <{audio}> element is <a>potentially playing</a>, it must have its audio
  data played synchronized with the <a>current playback position</a>, at the element's
  <a>effective media volume</a>. The user agent must play the audio from audio tracks that
  were enabled when the <a>event loop</a> last reached step 1.

  When an <{audio}> element is not <a>potentially playing</a>, audio must not play for the element.

  <dl class="domintro">

    <dt><var>audio</var> = new <code>Audio</code>( [ <var>url</var> ] )</dt>

    <dd>

    Returns a new <{audio}> element, with the <code>src</code>
    attribute set to the value passed in the argument, if applicable.

    </dd>

    A constructor is provided for creating <code>HTMLAudioElement</code> objects (in addition to
    the factory methods from DOM such as <code>createElement()</code>):
    <dfn constructor for="HTMLAudioElement"><code>Audio(<var>src</var>)</code></dfn>.
    When invoked as a constructor, it must return a new <code>HTMLAudioElement</code> object
    (a new <code>audio</code> element). The element must be created with its <code>preload</code>
    attribute set to the literal value "<code>auto</code>". If the <var>src</var> argument is
    present, the object created must be created with its <code>src</code> content attribute set
    to the provided value (this will cause the user agent to invoke the object's
    <a>resource selection algorithm</a> before returning).
    The element's <a>node document</a> must be the <a>active document</a> of the
    <a>browsing context</a> of the <code>Window</code> object on which the interface object
    of the invoked constructor is found.
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    This example shows how different audio files can be offered to the browser. If the browser does
    not support a specific codec, it can play one of the alternative files offered.

    This example also shows the boolean <{audio/controls}>, <{media/autoplay}>, and
    <{media/loop}> attributes.

  </div>

  <div class="warning">
  The audio element can be used to mimic parts of a voice interface such as a screen reader

  The attribute may be omitted. The <i>missing value default</i> is the
  <a attr-value for="track/kind">subtitles</a> state. The <i>invalid value default</i> is the
  <a attr-value for="track/kind">metadata</a> state.

  The <dfn element-attr for="track"><code>src</code></dfn> attribute gives the address of the text
  track data. The value must be a <a>valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces</a>.
  This attribute must be present.

  If the element has a <{track/src}> attribute whose value is not the empty string and whose
  value, when the attribute was set, could be successfully <a>parsed</a> relative to the element's
  <a>node document</a>, then the element's <dfn>track URL</dfn> is the
  <a>resulting URL string</a>. Otherwise, the element's <a>track URL</a> is the empty string.

    If the element's <a>track URL</a> identifies a <a>WebVTT</a> resource, and the element's
    <code>kind</code> attribute is not in the <a state for="track">Metadata</a> state, then the
    <a>WebVTT</a> file must be a <a>WebVTT file using cue text</a>. [[WEBVTT]]

    Furthermore, if the element's <a>track URL</a> identifies a <a>WebVTT</a> resource, and the
    element's <code>kind</code> attribute is in the <a>chapters</a> state, then the <a>WebVTT</a>

    <a>WebVTT file using only nested cues</a>. [[WEBVTT]]
  </div>

  The <dfn element-attr for="track"><code>srclang</code></dfn> attribute gives the language of
  the text track data. The value must be a valid BCP 47 language tag. This attribute must be
  present if the element's <code>kind</code> attribute is in the <a>subtitles</a> state. [[!BCP47]]

  If the element has a <code>srclang</code> attribute whose value is not the empty string,
  then the element's <dfn>track language</dfn> is the value of the attribute.
  Otherwise, the element has no <a>track language</a>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="track"><code>label</code></dfn> attribute gives a user-readable
  title for the track. This title is used by user agents when listing <a>subtitle</a>,
  <a>caption</a>, and <a state for="track" lt="Descriptions">audio description</a> tracks in
  their user interface.

  The value of the <code>label</code> attribute, if the attribute is present, must not be the
  empty string. Furthermore, there must not be two <code>track</code> element children of the
  same <a>media element</a> whose <code>kind</code> attributes are in the same state, whose
  <code>srclang</code> attributes are both missing or have values that represent the same
  language, and whose <code>label</code> attributes are again both missing or both have the
  same value.

  If the element has a <code>label</code> attribute whose value is not the empty string, then
  the element's <dfn>track label</dfn> is the value of the attribute. Otherwise, the element's
  <a>track label</a> is an empty string.

  The <dfn element-attr for="track"><code>default</code></dfn> attribute is a
  <a>boolean attribute</a>, which, if specified, indicates that the track is to be enabled
  if the user's preferences do not indicate that another track would be more appropriate.

  Each <a>media element</a> must have no more than one <{track}> element child
  whose <code>kind</code> attribute is in the <a state for="track">Subtitles</a> or
  <a state for="track">Captions</a> state and whose <{track/default}> attribute is specified.

  Each <a>media element</a> must have no more than one <{track}> element child
  whose <code>kind</code> attribute is in the <a state for="track">Descriptions</a> state
  and whose <{track/default}> attribute is specified.

  Each <a>media element</a> must have no more than one <{track}> element child whose
  <code>kind</code> attribute is in the <a state for="track">Chapters</a> state and

  <a>Media elements</a> are used to present audio data, or video and audio data, to the user.
  This is referred to as <dfn>media data</dfn> in this section, since this section applies equally

  The term <dfn lt="media resource|resource">media resource</dfn> is used to refer to the complete
  set of media data, e.g., the complete video file, or complete audio file.

  A <a>media resource</a> can have multiple audio and video tracks. For the purposes of a
  <a>media element</a>, the video data of the <a>media resource</a> is only that of the
  currently selected track (if any) as given by the element's <code>videoTracks</code> attribute
  when the <a>event loop</a> last reached step 1, and the audio data of the <a>media resource</a>
  is the result of mixing all the currently enabled tracks (if any) given by the element's
  <code>audioTracks</code> attribute when the <a>event loop</a> last reached step 1.

  <p class="note">
    Both <{audio}> and <{video}> elements can be used for both audio and video. The main
    difference between the two is simply that the <code>audio</code> element has no playback area
    for visual content (such as video or captions), whereas the <code>video</code> element does.

<h5 id="mime-types">MIME types</h5>

  A <a>media resource</a> can be described in terms of its <em>type</em>, specifically a
  <a>MIME type</a>, in some cases with a <code>codecs</code> parameter. (Whether the
  <code>codecs</code> parameter is allowed or not depends on the MIME type.) [[!RFC6381]]

  Types are usually somewhat incomplete descriptions; for example "<code>video/mpeg</code>"
  doesn't say anything except what the container type is, and even a type like
  "<code>video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"</code>" doesn't include information like the
  actual bitrate (only the maximum bitrate). Thus, given a type, a user agent can often only know
  whether it <em>might</em> be able to play media of that type (with varying levels of
  confidence), or whether it definitely <em>cannot</em> play media of that type.

  <dfn>A type that the user agent knows it cannot render</dfn> is one that describes a resource
  that the user agent definitely does not support, for example because it doesn't recognize the
  container type, or it doesn't support the listed codecs.

  The <a>MIME type</a> "<code>application/octet-stream</code>" with no parameters is never
  <a>a type that the user agent knows it cannot render</a>. User agents must treat that type
  as equivalent to the lack of any explicit <a>Content-Type metadata</a>
  when it is used to label a potential <a>media resource</a>.

  <p class="note">
    Only the <a>MIME type</a> "<code>application/octet-stream</code>" with no parameters is
    special-cased here; if any parameter appears with it, it will be treated just like any other
    <a>MIME type</a>. This is a deviation from the rule  that unknown <a>MIME type</a> parameters
    should be ignored.
  </p>

  <dl class="domintro">
    <dt><var>media</var> . <code>canPlayType</code>(<var>type</var>)</dt>
    <dd>
      Returns the empty string (a negative response), "maybe", or "probably" based on how confident
      the user agent is that it can play media resources of the given type.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  The <dfn method for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>canPlayType(<var>type</var>)</code></dfn> method
  must return <dfn>the empty string</dfn> if <var>type</var> is <a>a type that the user agent
  knows it cannot render</a> or is the type "<code>application/octet-stream</code>"; it must
  return "<dfn><code>probably</code></dfn>" if the user agent is confident that the type
  represents a <a>media resource</a> that it can render if used in with this <code>audio</code>
  or <{video}> element; and it must return "<dfn><code>maybe</code></dfn>" otherwise.
  Implementors are encouraged to return "<code>maybe</code>" unless the type can be
  confidently established as being supported or not. Generally, a user agent should never return
  "<code>probably</code>" for a type that allows the <code>codecs</code> parameter if that
  parameter is not present.

  <div class="example">
    This script tests to see if the user agent supports a (fictional) new format to dynamically
    decide whether to use a <{video}> element or a plugin:

    <dt><var>media</var> . {{HTMLMediaElement/networkState}}</dt>
    <dd>Returns the current state of network activity for the element, from the codes in the list

  </dl>

  As <a>media elements</a> interact with the network, their current network activity is represented
  by the <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>networkState</code></dfn> attribute. On
  getting, it must return the current network state of the element, which must be one of the
  following values:

  : <dfn const for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>NETWORK_EMPTY</code></dfn> (numeric value 0)
  :: The element has not yet been initialized. All attributes are in their initial states.

  : <dfn const for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>NETWORK_IDLE</code></dfn> (numeric value 1)
  :: The element's <a>resource selection algorithm</a> is active and has selected a

  changes in this state.

<h5 id="loading-the-media-resource">Loading the media resource</h5>

  <a>delay the load event</a> of its document.

  When the <dfn method for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>load()</code></dfn> method on a
  <a>media element</a> is invoked, the user agent must run the <a>media element load algorithm</a>.

  The <dfn>media element load algorithm</dfn> consists of the following steps.

  <ol>

    <p class="note">
      Basically, pending events and callbacks for the media element are discarded and
      pending promises are rejected when the media element starts loading a new resource.
    </p>

    </li>

    <li>If the <a>media element</a>'s <code>networkState</code> is set to <code>NETWORK_LOADING</code> or <code>NETWORK_IDLE</code>, <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a

    <li>If the <a>media element</a>'s <code>networkState</code> is not set to

    <ol>

      <li><a>Queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named <a event for="media">emptied</a> at the <a>media element</a>.</li>

      <li>If a fetching process is in progress for the <a>media element</a>, the user agent should stop it.</li>

      <li>If the <a>media element</a>'s <a>assigned media provider object</a> is a

  The <dfn>resource selection algorithm</dfn> for a <a>media element</a> is as follows. This
  algorithm is always invoked as part of a <a>task</a>, but one of the first steps in the
  algorithm is to return and continue running the remaining steps <a>in parallel</a>. In addition,
  this algorithm interacts closely with the <a>event loop</a> mechanism; in particular, it has
  <a>synchronous sections</a> (which are triggered as part of the <a>event loop</a> algorithm).
  Steps in such sections are marked with ⌛.

  <ol>

    <li>Set the element's <code>networkState</code> attribute to

        Set <var>request</var>'s <a>client</a> to the <a>media element</a>'s

        <a>Fetch</a> <var>request</var>.

        The <var>response</var>'s unsafe response obtained in this fashion, if any,
        contains the <a>media data</a>. It can be <a>CORS-same-origin</a> or
        <a>CORS-cross-origin</a>; this affects whether subtitles referenced in the <a>media
        data</a> are exposed in the API and, for <{video}> elements, whether a
        <code>canvas</code> gets tainted when the video is drawn on it.

        The <dfn>stall timeout</dfn> is a user-agent defined length of time, which should be about
        three seconds. When a <a>media element</a> that is actively attempting to obtain
        <a>media data</a> has failed to receive any data for a duration equal to the <a>stall
        timeout</a>, the user agent must <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple
        event</a> named <code>stalled</code> at the element.

        User agents may allow users to selectively block or slow <a>media data</a> downloads.
        When a <a>media element</a>'s download has been blocked altogether, the user agent must
        act as if it was stalled (as opposed to acting as if the connection was closed). The rate
        of the download may also be throttled automatically by the user agent, e.g., to balance
        the download with other connections sharing the same bandwidth.

        <dfn lt="the rules described previously"></dfn>User agents may decide to not download
        more content at any time, e.g., after buffering five minutes of a one hour media resource,
        while waiting for the user to decide whether to play the resource or not, while waiting
        for user input in an interactive resource, or when the user navigates away from the page.
        When a <a>media element</a>'s download has been suspended, the user agent must
        <a>queue a task</a>, to set the <code>networkState</code> to <code>NETWORK_IDLE</code>
        and <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>suspend</code> at the element. If and when
        downloading of the resource resumes, the user agent must <a>queue a task</a> to set the
        <code>networkState</code> to <code>NETWORK_LOADING</code>. Between the queuing of these
        tasks, the load is suspended (so <code>progress</code> events don't fire, as described
        above).

        <p class="note">
          The <code>preload</code> attribute provides a hint regarding how much buffering the
          author thinks is advisable, even in the absence of the <code>autoplay</code> attribute.
        </p>

        When a user agent decides to completely suspend a download, e.g., if it is waiting until
        the user starts playback before downloading any further content, the user agent must
        <a>queue a task</a> to set the element's <a>delaying-the-load-event flag</a> to
        false. This stops <a>delaying the load event</a>.

        The user agent may use whatever means necessary to fetch the resource (within the
        constraints put forward by this and other specifications); for example, reconnecting to
        the server in the face of network errors, using HTTP range retrieval requests, or
        switching to a streaming protocol. The user agent must consider a resource erroneous only
        if it has given up trying to fetch it.

        To determine the format of the <a>media resource</a>, the user agent must use the
        <a>rules for sniffing audio and video specifically</a>.

        While the load is not suspended (see below), every 350ms (±200ms) or for every byte
        received, whichever is <em>least</em> frequent, <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple
        event</a> named <code>progress</code> at the element.

        The <a>networking task source</a> <a>tasks</a> to process the data as it is being fetched
        must each <a>immediately</a> <a>queue a task</a> to run the first appropriate steps from
        the <a>media data processing steps list</a> below. (A new task is used for this so that
        the work described below occurs relative to the <a>media element event task source</a>
        rather than the <a>networking task source</a>.)

        When the <a>networking task source</a> has <a>queued</a> the last <a>task</a> as part of
        fetching the <a>media resource</a> (i.e., once the download has completed), if the
        fetching process completes without errors, including decoding the media data, and if all
        of the data is available to the user agent without network access, then, the user agent
        must move on to the <i>final step</i> below. This might never happen, e.g., when streaming
        an infinite resource such as Web radio, or if the resource is longer than the user agent's
        ability to cache data.

        While the user agent might still need network access to obtain parts of the
        <a>media resource</a>, the user agent must remain on this step.

        <p class="example">
          For example, if the user agent has discarded the first half of a video, the  user agent
          will remain at this step even once the <a>playback has ended</a>, because there is
          always the chance the user will seek back to the start. In fact, in this situation,
          once <a>playback has ended</a>, the user agent will end up firing a <code>suspend</code>
          event, as described earlier.
        </p>

      <dd>

      The resource described by the <var>current media resource</var>, if any, contains the
      <a>media data</a>. It is <a>CORS-same-origin</a>.

      If the <var>current media resource</var> is a raw data stream (e.g., from a
      <code>File</code> object), then to determine the format of the <a>media resource</a>,
      the user agent must use the <a>rules for sniffing audio and video specifically</a>.
      Otherwise, if the data stream is pre-decoded, then the format is the format given by the
      relevant specification.

      Set the element’s [=delaying-the-load-event flag=] to false. This stops
      [=delay the load event|delaying the load event=] when the resource is local.

      Whenever new data for the <var>current media resource</var> becomes available,
      <a>queue a task</a> to run the first appropriate steps from the
      <a>media data processing steps list</a> below.

      When the <var>current media resource</var> is permanently exhausted (e.g., all the bytes of
      a <code>Blob</code> have been processed), if there were no decoding errors, then the user
      agent must move on to the <i>final step</i> below. This might never happen, e.g., if the
      <var>current media resource</var> is a <code>MediaStream</code>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="media"><code>preload</code></dfn> attribute is an <a>enumerated
  attribute</a>. The following table lists the keywords and states for the attribute — the
  keywords in the left column map to the states in the cell in the second column on the same row as
  the keyword. The attribute can be changed even once the <a>media resource</a> is being
  buffered or played; the descriptions in the table below are to be interpreted with that in mind.

      </td><td>Hints to the user agent that either the author does not expect the user to need the media resource, or that the server wants to minimize unnecessary traffic.
          This state does not provide a hint regarding how aggressively to actually download the media resource if buffering starts anyway (e.g., once the user hits "play").
    </td></tr><tr>
      <td><dfn value for="HTMLMediaElement/preload"><code>metadata</code></dfn>
      </td><td><dfn state for="media">Metadata</dfn>
      </td><td>Hints to the user agent that the author does not expect the user to need the media resource, but that fetching the resource metadata (dimensions, track list, duration, etc), and maybe even the first few frames, is reasonable. If the user agent precisely fetches no more than the metadata, then the <a>media element</a> will end up with its <code>readyState</code> attribute set to <code>HAVE_METADATA</code>; typically though, some frames will be obtained as well and it will probably be <code>HAVE_CURRENT_DATA</code> or <code>HAVE_FUTURE_DATA</code>.
          When the media resource is playing, hints to the user agent that bandwidth is to be considered scarce, e.g., suggesting throttling the download so that the media data is obtained at the slowest possible rate that still maintains consistent playback.

  </td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  The empty string is also a valid keyword, and maps to the
  <a state for="media">Automatic</a> state. The attribute's <i>missing value default</i> is
  user-agent defined, though the <a state for="media">Metadata</a> state is suggested as a
  compromise between reducing server load and providing an optimal user experience.

  <p class="note">
    Authors might switch the attribute from "<code>none</code>" or "<code>metadata</code>" to
    "<code>auto</code>" dynamically once the user begins playback. For example, on a page with
    many videos this might be used to indicate that the many videos are not to be downloaded
    unless requested, but that once one <em>is</em> requested it is to be downloaded aggressively.
  </p>

  The <code>preload</code> attribute is intended to provide a hint to the user agent about what
  the author thinks will lead to the best user experience. The attribute may be ignored
  altogether, for example based on explicit user preferences or based on the available
  connectivity.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>preload</code></dfn> IDL attribute must
  <a>reflect</a> the content attribute of the same name, <a>limited to only known values</a>.

  <p class="note">
    The <code>autoplay</code> attribute can override the <code>preload</code> attribute
    (since if the media plays, it naturally has to buffer first, regardless of the hint given
    by the <code>preload</code> attribute). Including both is not an error.

  </dl>

  A <a>media resource</a> has a <dfn>media timeline</dfn> that maps times (in seconds) to
  positions in the <a>media resource</a>. The origin of a timeline is its earliest defined
  position. The duration of a timeline is its last defined position.

  <dfn lt="establish the media timeline|establishing the media timeline">Establishing the media timeline</dfn>:
  If the <a>media resource</a> somehow specifies an explicit timeline whose origin is not negative
  (i.e., gives each frame a specific time offset and gives the first frame a zero or positive
  offset), then the <a>media timeline</a> should be that timeline. (Whether the
  <a>media resource</a> can specify a timeline or not depends on the <a>media resource's</a>
  format.) If the <a>media resource</a> specifies an explicit start time <em>and date</em>,
  then that time and date should be considered the zero point in the <a>media timeline</a>; the
  <a>timeline offset</a> will be the time and date, exposed using the
  <code>getStartDate()</code> method.

  If the <a>media resource</a> has a discontinuous timeline, the user agent must extend the
  timeline used at the start of the resource across the entire resource, so that the <a>media
  timeline</a> of the <a>media resource</a> increases linearly starting from the
  <a>earliest possible position</a> (as defined below), even if the underlying <a>media
  data</a> has out-of-order or even overlapping time codes.

  <p class="example">
    For example, if two clips have been concatenated into one video file, but the video format
    exposes the original times for the two clips, the video data might expose a timeline that
    goes, say, 00:15..00:29 and then 00:05..00:38. However, the user agent would not expose those
    times; it would instead expose the times as 00:15..00:29 and 00:29..01:02, as a single video.
  </p>

  In the rare case of a <a>media resource</a> that does not have an explicit timeline, the
  zero time on the <a>media timeline</a> should correspond to the first frame of the
  <a>media resource</a>. In the even rarer case of a <a>media resource</a> with no
  explicit timings of any kind, not even frame durations, the user agent must itself determine the
  time for each frame in a user-agent-defined manner.
  <a class="fingerprint" href="#fingerprinting-vector"><img height="21" src="images/fingerprint.png" width="15" alt="(This is a fingerprinting vector.)" /></a>

  <p class="note">
    An example of a file format with no explicit timeline but with explicit frame durations is
    the Animated GIF format. An example of a file format with no explicit timings at all is the
    JPEG-push format (<code>multipart/x-mixed-replace</code> with JPEG frames, often used as the
    format for MJPEG streams).
  </p>

  If, in the case of a resource with no timing information, the user agent will nonetheless be
  able to seek to an earlier point than the first frame originally provided by the server, then the
  zero time should correspond to the earliest seekable time of the <a>media resource</a>;
  otherwise, it should correspond to the first frame received from the server (the point in the
  <a>media resource</a> at which the user agent began receiving the stream).

  <p class="note">
    At the time of writing, there is no known format that lacks explicit frame time
    offsets yet still supports seeking to a frame before the first frame sent by the server.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    Consider a stream from a TV broadcaster, which begins streaming on a sunny Friday afternoon in
    October, and always sends connecting user agents the media data on the same media timeline,
    with its zero time set to the start of this stream. Months later, user agents connecting to
    this stream will find that the first frame they receive has a time with millions of seconds.
    The <code>getStartDate()</code> method would always return the date that the
    broadcast started; this would allow controllers to display real times in their scrubber (e.g.,
    "2:30pm") rather than a time relative to when the broadcast began ("8 months, 4 hours, 12
    minutes, and 23 seconds").

    Consider a stream that carries a video with several concatenated fragments, broadcast by a
    server that does not allow user agents to request specific times but instead just streams the
    video data in a predetermined order, with the first frame delivered always being identified as
    the frame with time zero. If a user agent connects to this stream and receives fragments
    defined as covering timestamps 2010-03-20 23:15:00 UTC to 2010-03-21 00:05:00 UTC and
    2010-02-12 14:25:00 UTC to 2010-02-12 14:35:00 UTC, it would expose this with a
    <a>media timeline</a> starting at 0s and extending to 3,600s (one hour). Assuming the
    streaming server disconnected at the end of the second clip, the <code>duration</code>
    attribute would then return 3,600. The <code>getStartDate()</code> method would return a
    {{Date}} object with a time corresponding to 2010-03-20 23:15:00 UTC. However, if a
    different user agent connected five minutes later, <em>it</em> would (presumably) receive
    fragments covering timestamps 2010-03-20 23:20:00 UTC to 2010-03-21 00:05:00 UTC and 2010-02-12
    14:25:00 UTC to 2010-02-12 14:35:00 UTC, and would expose this with a <a>media timeline</a>
    starting at 0s and extending to 3,300s (fifty five minutes). In this case, the
    <code>getStartDate()</code> method would return a {{Date}} object
    with a time corresponding to 2010-03-20 23:20:00 UTC.

    In both of these examples, the <code>seekable</code> attribute would give the ranges that
    the controller would want to actually display in its UI; typically, if
    the servers don't support seeking to arbitrary times, this would be the range of time from the
    moment the user agent connected to the stream up to the latest frame that the user agent has
    obtained; however, if the user agent starts discarding earlier information, the actual range
    might be shorter.

  </div>

  In any case, the user agent must ensure that the <a>earliest possible position</a> (as
  defined below) using the established <a>media timeline</a>, is greater than or equal to zero.

  The <a>media timeline</a> also has an associated clock. Which clock is used is user-agent
  defined, and may be <a>media resource</a>-dependent, but it should approximate the user's
  wall clock.

  <a>Media elements</a> have a
  <dfn lt="current position|current playback position">current playback position</dfn>,
  which must initially (i.e., in the absence of <a>media data</a>) be zero seconds. The
  <a>current playback position</a> is a time on the <a>media timeline</a>.

  <a>Media elements</a> also have an <dfn>official playback
  position</dfn>, which must initially be set to zero seconds. The <a>official playback
  position</a> is an approximation of the <a>current playback position</a> that is kept
  stable while scripts are running.

  <a>Media elements</a> also have a <dfn>default playback start position</dfn>, which must
  initially be set to zero seconds. This time is used to allow the
  element to be seeked even before the media is loaded.

  Each <a>media element</a> has a <dfn>show poster flag</dfn>. When a <a>media element</a>
  is created, this flag must be set to true. This flag is used to control when the user agent
  is to show a poster frame for a <{video}> element instead of showing the video contents.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>currentTime</code></dfn> attribute must, on
  getting, return the <a>media element</a>'s <a>default playback start position</a>,
  unless that is zero, in which case it must return the element's <a>official playback
  position</a>. The returned value must be expressed in seconds. On setting, if the
  <a>media element</a>'s <code>readyState</code> is <code>HAVE_NOTHING</code>,
  then it must set the <a>media element</a>'s <a>default playback start position</a> to the
  new value; otherwise, it must set the <a>official playback position</a> to the new value and
  then <a>seek</a> to the new value. The new value must be interpreted as being in seconds.

  <a>Media elements</a> have an <dfn>initial playback position</dfn>,
  which must initially (i.e., in the absence of <a>media data</a>) be zero seconds. The
  <a>initial playback position</a> is updated when a <a>media resource</a> is loaded.
  The <a>initial playback position</a> is a time on the <a>media timeline</a>.

  If the <a>media resource</a> is a streaming resource, then the user agent might be unable
  to obtain certain parts of the resource after it has expired from its buffer. Similarly, some
  <a>media resources</a> might have a <a>media timeline</a> that doesn't start at zero.
  The <dfn>earliest possible position</dfn> is the earliest position in the stream or resource
  that the user agent can ever obtain again. It is also a time on the <a>media timeline</a>.

  <p class="note">
    The <a>earliest possible position</a> is not explicitly exposed in the API; it corresponds to
    the start time of the first range in the <code>seekable</code> attribute's
    <code>TimeRanges</code> object, if any, or the <a>current playback position</a> otherwise.
  </p>

  When the <a>earliest possible position</a> changes, then: if the <a>current playback
  position</a> is before the <a>earliest possible position</a>, the user agent must
  <a>seek</a> to the <a>earliest possible position</a>; otherwise, if the user agent has not
  fired a <code>timeupdate</code> event at the element in the past 15 to 250ms and is not still
  running event handlers for such an event, then the user agent must <a>queue a task</a> to
  <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>timeupdate</code> at the element.

  <p class="note">
    Because of the above requirement and the requirement in the <a>resource fetch algorithm</a>
    that kicks in
    <a href="#getting-media-metadata">when the metadata of the clip becomes known</a>,
    the <a>current playback position</a> can never be less than the
    <a>earliest possible position</a>.
  </p>

  If at any time the user agent learns that an audio or video track has ended and all
  <a>media data</a> relating to that track corresponds to parts of the <a>media timeline</a> that
  are <em>before</em> the <a>earliest possible position</a>, the user agent may
  <a>queue a task</a> to first remove the track from the <code>audioTracks</code>
  attribute's <code>AudioTrackList</code> object or the <code>videoTracks</code> attribute's
  {{VideoTrackList}} object as appropriate and then <a>fire</a> a <a>trusted</a> event with the
  name <code>removetrack</code>, that does not bubble and is not cancelable, and that
  uses the {{TrackEvent}} interface, with the <code>track</code> attribute initialized to the
  <code>AudioTrack</code> or <code>VideoTrack</code> object representing the track, at the
  <a>media element</a>'s aforementioned <code>AudioTrackList</code> or {{VideoTrackList}} object.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>duration</code></dfn> attribute must return
  the time of the end of the <a>media resource</a>, in seconds, on the <a>media timeline</a>.
  If no <a>media data</a> is available, then the attributes must return the Not-a-Number (NaN)
  value. If the <a>media resource</a> is not known to be bounded (e.g., streaming radio, or a
  live event with no announced end time), then the attribute must return the positive Infinity
  value.

  The user agent must determine the duration of the <a>media resource</a> before playing
  any part of the <a>media data</a> and before setting <code>readyState</code> to a value equal
  to or greater than <code>HAVE_METADATA</code>, even if doing so requires fetching multiple
  parts of the resource.

  <p id="durationChange">
    When the length of the <a>media resource</a> changes to a known value (e.g., from being
    unknown to known, or from a previously established length to a new length) the user agent must
    <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named
    <a event for="media">durationchange</a> at the <a>media element</a>. (The event is not fired
    when the duration is reset as part of loading a new media resource.) If the duration is
    changed such that the <a>current playback position</a> ends up being greater than the time of
    the end of the <a>media resource</a>, then the user agent must also
    <a>seek</a> to the time of the end of the <a>media resource</a>.
  </p>

  <p class="example">
    If an "infinite" stream ends for some reason, then the duration would change from positive
    Infinity to the time of the last frame or sample in the stream, and the
    <code>durationchange</code> event would be fired. Similarly, if the user agent initially
    estimated the <a>media resource</a>'s duration instead of determining it precisely, and later
    revises the estimate based on new information, then the duration would change and the
    <code>durationchange</code> event would be fired.
  </p>

  Some video files also have an explicit date and time corresponding to the zero time in the
  <a>media timeline</a>, known as the <dfn>timeline offset</dfn>. Initially, the
  <a>timeline offset</a> must be set to Not-a-Number (NaN).

  The <dfn method for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>getStartDate()</code></dfn> method must return
  <a>a new <code>Date</code> object</a> representing the current <a>timeline offset</a>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="media"><code>loop</code></dfn> attribute is a <a>boolean

    <a>current playback position</a>, from the codes in the list below.

    </dd>

  </dl>

  <a>Media elements</a> have a <i>ready state</i>, which describes to
  what degree they are ready to be rendered at the <a>current playback position</a>. The
  possible values are as follows; the ready state of a media element at any particular time is the
  greatest value describing the state of the element:

  <dl>

    <dt><dfn const for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>HAVE_NOTHING</code></dfn> (numeric value 0)</dt>

    <dd>No information regarding the <a>media resource</a> is available. No data for the
    <a>current playback position</a> is available. <a>Media elements</a> whose <code>networkState</code> attribute are set
    to <code>NETWORK_EMPTY</code> are always in the <code>HAVE_NOTHING</code> state.</dd>

    <dt><dfn const for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>HAVE_METADATA</code></dfn> (numeric value 1)</dt>

    <dd>Enough of the resource has been obtained that the duration of the resource is available.
    In the case of a <{video}> element, the dimensions of the video are also available. No
    <a>media data</a> is available for the immediate <a>current playback
    position</a>.</dd>

    <dt><dfn const for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>HAVE_CURRENT_DATA</code></dfn> (numeric value 2)</dt>

    <dd>Data for the immediate <a>current playback position</a> is available, but either not
    enough data is available that the user agent could successfully advance the <a>current
    playback position</a> in the <a>direction of playback</a> at all without immediately
    reverting to the <code>HAVE_METADATA</code> state, or there is no
    more data to obtain in the <a>direction of playback</a>. For example, in video this
    corresponds to the user agent having data from the current frame, but not the next frame, when
    the <a>current playback position</a> is at the end of the current frame; and to when <a>playback has ended</a>.</dd>

    <dt><dfn const for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>HAVE_FUTURE_DATA</code></dfn> (numeric value 3)</dt>

    <dd>Data for the immediate <a>current playback position</a> is available, as well as
    enough data for the user agent to advance the <a>current playback position</a> in the
    <a>direction of playback</a> at least a little without immediately reverting to the <code>HAVE_METADATA</code> state, and <a>the text tracks are
    ready</a>. For example, in video this corresponds to the user agent having data for at least
    the current frame and the next frame when the <a>current playback position</a> is at the
    instant in time between the two frames, or to the user agent having the video data for the
    current frame and audio data to keep playing at least a little when the <a>current playback
    position</a> is in the middle of a frame. The user agent cannot be in this state if <a>playback has ended</a>, as the <a>current playback position</a>
    can never advance in this case.</dd>

    <dt><dfn const for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA</code></dfn> (numeric value 4)</dt>

    <dd>

    All the conditions described for the <code>HAVE_FUTURE_DATA</code> state are met, and, in addition,
    either of the following conditions is also true:

    <ul>

      <li>The user agent estimates that data is being fetched at a rate where the <a>current
      playback position</a>, if it were to advance at the <a>effective playback rate</a>,
      would not overtake the available data before playback reaches the end of the <a>media
      resource</a>.</li>

      <li>The user agent has entered a state where waiting longer will not result in further data
      being obtained, and therefore nothing would be gained by delaying playback any further. (For
      example, the buffer might be full.)</li>

    </ul>

    </dd>

  </dl>

  <p class="note">
    In practice, the difference between <code>HAVE_METADATA</code> and
    <code>HAVE_CURRENT_DATA</code> is negligible. Really the only time the difference is
    relevant is when painting a <{video}> element onto a <{canvas}>, where it distinguishes the
    case where something will be drawn (<code>HAVE_CURRENT_DATA</code> or greater) from the case
    where nothing is drawn (<code>HAVE_METADATA</code> or less). Similarly, the difference between
    <code>HAVE_CURRENT_DATA</code> (only the current frame) and <code>HAVE_FUTURE_DATA</code>
    (at least this frame and the next) can be negligible (in the extreme, only one frame). The
    only time that distinction really matters is when a page provides an interface for
    "frame-by-frame" navigation.
  </p>

  When the ready state of a <a>media element</a> whose <code>networkState</code> is not
  <code>NETWORK_EMPTY</code> changes, the user agent must follow the steps given below:

  <ol>

    <li>

    Apply the first applicable set of substeps from the following list:

    <dl class="switch">

      <dt>If the previous ready state was <code>HAVE_NOTHING</code>,
      and the new ready state is <code>HAVE_METADATA</code></dt>

      <dd id="fire-loadedmetadata">

      <a>Queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>loadedmetadata</code>
      at the element.

      <p class="note">
        Before this task is run, as part of the <a>event loop</a> mechanism, the
        rendering will have been updated to resize the <{video}> element if appropriate.
      </p>

      </dd>

      <dt id="handling-first-frame-available">If the previous ready state was
      <code>HAVE_METADATA</code> and the new ready state is <code>HAVE_CURRENT_DATA</code>
      or greater</dt>

      <dd>

      If this is the first time this occurs for this <a>media element</a> since the
      <code>load()</code> algorithm was last invoked, the user agent must <a>queue a task</a> to
      <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>loadeddata</code> at the element.

      If the new ready state is <code>HAVE_FUTURE_DATA</code> or <code>HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA</code>,
      then the relevant steps below must then be run also.

      </dd>

      <dt>If the previous ready state was <code>HAVE_FUTURE_DATA</code> or more, and the new
      ready state is <code>HAVE_CURRENT_DATA</code> or less</dt>

      <dd>

      If the <a>media element</a> was <a>potentially playing</a> before its
      <code>readyState</code> attribute changed to a value lower than
      <code>HAVE_FUTURE_DATA</code>, and the element has not <a>ended playback</a>, and playback
      has not <a>stopped due to errors</a>, <a>paused for user interaction</a>, or
      <a>paused for in-band content</a>, the user agent must <a>queue a task</a> to
      <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>timeupdate</code> at the element, and
      <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>waiting</code> at the element.

      </dd>

      <dt>If the previous ready state was <code>HAVE_CURRENT_DATA</code> or less, and the new
      ready state is <code>HAVE_FUTURE_DATA</code></dt>

      <dd>

      The user agent must <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named
      <code>canplay</code> at the element.

      If the element's {{HTMLMediaElement/paused}} attribute is false, the user
      agent must <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>playing</code>
      at the element.

      </dd>

      <dt>If the new ready state is <code>HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA</code></dt>

      <dd>

      If the previous ready state was <code>HAVE_CURRENT_DATA</code> or less, the user agent must
      <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>canplay</code> at the element,
      and, if the element's {{HTMLMediaElement/paused}} attribute is false, <a>queue a task</a> to
      <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>playing</code>
      at the element.

      If the <a>autoplaying flag</a> is true, and the {{HTMLMediaElement/paused}} attribute is
      true, and the <a>media element</a> has an <code>autoplay</code> attribute specified, and the
      <a>media element</a>'s <a>node document</a>'s <a>active sandboxing flag set</a>
      does not have the <a>sandboxed automatic features browsing context flag</a> set, then
      the user agent may also run the following substeps:

      <ol>

        <li>Set the {{HTMLMediaElement/paused}} attribute to false.</li>

        <li>If the element's <a>show poster flag</a> is true, set it to false and run the
        <i>time marches on</i> steps.</li>

        <li><a>Queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named
        <a event for="media"><code>play</code></a> at the element.</li>

        <li><a>Queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>playing</code> at the element.</li>

        <li>Set the <a>autoplaying flag</a> to false.</li>

      </ol>

      <p class="note">
        User agents do not need to support autoplay, and it is suggested that user
        agents honor user preferences on the matter. Authors are urged to use the
        <code>autoplay</code> attribute rather than using script to force the
        video to play, so as to allow the user to override the behavior if so desired.
      </p>

      In any case, the user agent must finally <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a>
      named <code>canplaythrough</code> at the element.

      </dd>

    </dl>

    </li>

  </ol>

  <p class="note">
    It is possible for the ready state of a media element to jump between these states
    discontinuously. For example, the state of a media element can jump straight from
    <code>HAVE_METADATA</code> to <code>HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA</code> without passing through the
    <code>HAVE_CURRENT_DATA</code> and <code>HAVE_FUTURE_DATA</code> states.
  </p>

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>readyState</code></dfn> IDL attribute must, on
  getting, return the value described above that describes the current ready state of the
  <a>media element</a>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="media"><code>autoplay</code></dfn> attribute is a <a>boolean
  attribute</a>. When present, the user agent (as described in the algorithm
  described herein) will automatically begin playback of the <a>media resource</a> as
  soon as it can do so without stopping.

  <p class="note">
    Authors are urged to use the <code>autoplay</code> attribute rather than using script to
    trigger automatic playback, as this allows the user to override the automatic playback when
    it is not desired, e.g., when using a screen reader. Authors are also encouraged to consider
    not using the automatic playback behavior at all, and instead to let the user agent wait for
    the user to start playback explicitly.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>paused</code></dfn> attribute represents whether
  the <a>media element</a> is paused or not. The attribute must initially be true.

  A <a>media element</a> is a <dfn>blocked media element</dfn> if its <code>readyState</code> attribute is in the <code>HAVE_NOTHING</code> state, the <code>HAVE_METADATA</code> state, or the <code>HAVE_CURRENT_DATA</code> state, or if the element has
  <a>paused for user interaction</a> or <a>paused for in-band content</a>.

  A <a>media element</a> is said to be <dfn>potentially playing</dfn> when its
  {{HTMLMediaElement/paused}} attribute is false, the element has not <a>ended playback</a>,
  playback has not <a>stopped due to errors</a>, and the element is not a

  <p class="note">
    A <code>waiting</code> DOM event can be <a>fired</a> as a result of an element that is

    changing to a value lower than <code>HAVE_FUTURE_DATA</code>.
  </p>

  A <a>media element</a> is said to have
  <dfn lt="playback has ended|ended playback|playback ended">ended playback</dfn> when:

  <ul>

    <li>The element's <code>readyState</code> attribute is <code>HAVE_METADATA</code> or greater, and</li><li>

      and

      </li><li>The <a>direction of playback</a> is backwards.

    </li></ul>

    </li>

  </ul>

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>ended</code></dfn> attribute must return true if,
  the last time the <a>event loop</a> reached step 1, the <a>media element</a> had
  <a>ended playback</a> and the <a>direction of playback</a> was forwards, and false otherwise.

  A <a>media element</a> is said to have <dfn>stopped due to errors</dfn> when the
  element's <code>readyState</code> attribute is <code>HAVE_METADATA</code> or greater, and the
  user agent <a href="#non-fatal-media-error">encounters a non-fatal error</a> during the
  processing of the <a>media data</a>, and due to that error, is not able to play the content at
  the <a>current playback position</a>.

  A <a>media element</a> is said to have <dfn>paused for user interaction</dfn> when its
  {{HTMLMediaElement/paused}} attribute is false, the {{HTMLMediaElement/readyState}} attribute is
  either <code>HAVE_FUTURE_DATA</code> or <code>HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA</code> and the user agent has
  reached a point in the <a>media resource</a> where the user has to make a selection for the
  resource to continue.

  It is possible for a <a>media element</a> to have both <a>ended playback</a> and
  <a>paused for user interaction</a> at the same time.

  When a <a>media element</a> that is <a>potentially playing</a> stops playing
  because it has <a>paused for user interaction</a>, the user agent must <a>queue a
  task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>timeupdate</code> at the element.

  A <a>media element</a> is said to have <dfn>paused for in-band content</dfn> when its
  {{HTMLMediaElement/paused}} attribute is false, the {{HTMLMediaElement/readyState}} attribute is
  either <code>HAVE_FUTURE_DATA</code> or <code>HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA</code> and the user agent has
  suspended playback of the <a>media resource</a> in order to play content that is temporally
  anchored to the <a>media resource</a> and has a non-zero length, or to play content that is
  temporally anchored to a segment of the <a>media resource</a> but has a length longer than
  that segment.

  <p class="example">
    One example of when a <a>media element</a> would be <a>paused for in-band content</a> is when
    the user agent is playing  <a state for="track" lt="Descriptions">audio descriptions</a> from
    an external WebVTT file, and the synthesized speech generated for a cue is longer than the
    time between the <a>text track cue start time</a> and the <a>text track cue end time</a>.
  </p>

  When the <a>current playback position</a> reaches the end of the <a>media resource</a> when the

  <ol>

    <li>If the <a>media element</a> has a <code>loop</code> attribute specified, then
    <a>seek</a> to the <a>earliest possible position</a> of the <a>media resource</a> and abort
    these steps.</li>

    <li>As defined above, the {{HTMLMediaElement/ended}} IDL attribute starts
    returning true once the <a>event loop</a> returns to step 1.</li>

    <li><a>Queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>timeupdate</code> at the
    <a>media element</a>.</li>

    <li><a>Queue a task</a> that, if the <a>media element</a> has still <a>ended playback</a>, and
    the <a>direction of playback</a> is still forwards, and {{HTMLMediaElement/paused}} is false,
    changes {{HTMLMediaElement/paused}} to true and <a>fires a simple event</a> named
    <code>pause</code> at the <a>media element</a>, [=take pending play promises=] and
    [=reject pending play promises=] with the result and an {{AbortError}} {{DOMException}}.</li>

    <li><a>Queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>ended</code> at the
    <a>media element</a>.</li>

  </ol>

  When the <a>current playback position</a> reaches the <a>earliest possible position</a> of the
  <a>media resource</a> when the <a>direction of playback</a> is backwards, then the user agent
  must only <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>timeupdate</code> at
  the element.

  <p class="note">
    The word "reaches" here does not imply that the <a>current playback position</a> needs to have
    changed during normal playback; it could be via <a>seeking</a>, for instance.
  </p>

  <hr />

  The <dfn element-attr for="media"><code>remote</code></dfn> attribute MUST return the
  <a>RemotePlayback object</a> associated with the <a lt="media elements">media element</a>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="media"><code>disableRemotePlayback</code></dfn> attribute is a
  <a>boolean attribute</a>. When present, the user agent MUST NOT play the
  <a lt="media elements">media element</a> remotely or present any UI to do so.

  When the <{media/disableRemotePlayback}> attribute is added to the
  <a lt="media elements">media element</a>, the user agent MUST run the steps to
  <a>disable remote playback</a>.

  A corresponding  <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>disableRemotePlayback</code></dfn>
  IDL attribute  which reflects the value of each element’s <{media/disableRemotePlayback}> content

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>defaultPlaybackRate</code></dfn> attribute
  gives the desired speed at which the <a>media resource</a> is to play, as a multiple of its
  intrinsic speed. The attribute is mutable: on getting it must return the last value it was set
  to, or 1.0 if it hasn't yet been set; on setting the attribute must be set to the new value.

  <p class="note">
    The {{HTMLMediaElement/defaultPlaybackRate}} is used by the user agent when it
    <a>exposes a user interface to the user</a>.
  </p>

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>playbackRate</code></dfn> attribute gives the
  <a>effective playback rate</a> which is the speed at which the <a>media resource</a> plays, as a
  multiple of its intrinsic speed. If it is not equal to the
  {{HTMLMediaElement/defaultPlaybackRate}}, then the implication is that the user is using a
  feature such as fast forward or slow motion playback. The attribute is mutable: on getting it
  must return the last value it was set to, or 1.0 if it hasn't yet been set; on setting the
  attribute must be set to the new value, and the playback will change speed (if the element is
  <a>potentially playing</a>).

  When the {{HTMLMediaElement/defaultPlaybackRate}} or {{HTMLMediaElement/playbackRate}} attributes
  change value (either by being set by script or by being changed directly by the user agent, e.g.,
  in response to user control) the user agent must <a>queue a task</a> to
  <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>ratechange</code> at the <a>media element</a>.

  <hr />

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>played</code></dfn> attribute must return a new
  static <a>normalized <code>TimeRanges</code> object</a> that represents the ranges of points on
  the <a>media timeline</a> of the <a>media resource</a> reached through the usual monotonic
  increase of the <a>current playback position</a> during normal playback, if any, at the time
  the attribute is evaluated.

  <hr />

  Each [=media element=] has a <dfn>list of pending play promises</dfn>, which must be initially
  empty.

  To <dfn>take pending play promises</dfn> for a <a>media element</a>, the user agent must run
  the following steps:

  <ol>
    <li>Let <var>promise</var>s be an empty list of promises.</li>

    <li>Copy the [=media element=]'s [=list of pending play promises=] to promises.</li>

    <li>Clear the [=media element=]'s [=list of pending play promises=].</li>

    <li>Return *promise*s.</li>
  </ol>

  To <dfn>resolve pending play promises</dfn> for a [=media element=] with a list of
  promises <i>promises</i>, the user agent must resolve each promise in
  <i>promises</i> with undefined.

  To <dfn>reject pending play promises</dfn> for a [=media element=] with a list of promise
  promises and an exception name error, the user agent must reject each
  promise in promises with error.

  To <dfn>notify about playing</dfn> for a [=media element=], the user agent must run the
  following steps:

  <ol>
    <li><a>Take pending play promises</a> and let <i>promises</i> be the result.</li>

    <li><a>Queue a task</a> to run these steps:</li>

    <ol>
      <li><a>Fire an event</a> named playing at the element.</li>

      <li><a>Resolve pending play promises</a> with promises.</li>
  </ol>

  <hr />

  When the <dfn method for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>play()</code></dfn> method on a
  <a>media element</a> is invoked, the user agent must run the following steps.

  <ol>
    <li>
      If the [=media element=] is not allowed to play, return a promise rejected
      with a "{{NotAllowedError}}" {{DOMException}}.

      <p class="note">
        For example, a user agent could require user interaction in order to start
        playback. This specification does not require any particular behavior.

    <li>
      If the [=media element=]'s {{HTMLMediaElement/error}} attribute is not null and its

  When the <dfn method for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>pause()</code></dfn> method is invoked, and

  <ol>

    <li>Set the <a>media element</a>'s <a>autoplaying flag</a> to false.</li>

    <li>If the <a>media element</a>'s {{HTMLMediaElement/paused}} attribute

    </ol>

    </li>

  </ol>

  <hr />

  The <dfn>effective playback rate</dfn> is just the element's <code>playbackRate</code>.

  If the <a>effective playback rate</a> is positive or zero, then the <dfn>direction of
  playback</dfn> is forwards. Otherwise, it is backwards.

  When a <a>media element</a> is <a>potentially playing</a> and its {{Document}} is a
  <a>fully active</a> {{Document}}, its <a>current playback position</a> must increase
  monotonically at <a>effective playback rate</a> units of media time per unit time of the
  <a>media timeline</a>'s clock. (This specification always refers to this as an <i>increase</i>,
  but that increase could actually be a <em>de</em>crease if the <a>effective playback rate</a>
  is negative.)

  <p class="note">
    The <a>effective playback rate</a> can be 0.0, in which case the
    <a>current playback position</a> doesn't move, despite playback not being paused
    ({{HTMLMediaElement/paused}} doesn't become true, and the <code>pause</code> event
    doesn't fire).
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    This specification doesn't define how the user agent achieves the appropriate playback rate —
    depending on the protocol and media available, it is plausible that the user agent could
    negotiate with the server to have the server provide the media data at the appropriate rate,
    so that (except for the period between when the rate is changed and when the server updates
    the stream's playback rate) the client doesn't actually have to drop or interpolate any frames.
  </p>

  Any time the user agent <a>provides a stable state</a>, the <a>official playback position</a>
  must be set to the <a>current playback position</a>.

  While the <a>direction of playback</a> is backwards, any corresponding audio must be
  <a>muted</a>. While the <a>effective playback rate</a> is so low or so high that the user agent
  cannot play audio usefully, the corresponding audio must also be <a>muted</a>. If the
  <a>effective playback rate</a> is not 1.0, the user agent may apply pitch adjustments to the
  audio as necessary to render it faithfully.

  <a>Media elements</a> that are <a>potentially playing</a> while not
  <a>in a <code>Document</code></a> must not play any video, but should play any audio component.
  Media elements must not stop playing just because all references to them have been removed; only
  once a media element is in a state where no further audio could ever be played by that element
  may the element be garbage collected.

  <p class="note">
    It is possible for an element to which no explicit references exist to play audio, even if such
    an element is not still actively playing: for instance, a <a>media element</a> whose
    <a>media resource</a> has no audio tracks could eventually play audio again if it had an
    event listener that changes the <a>media resource</a>.

  <hr />

  Each <a>media element</a> has a <dfn>list of newly introduced cues</dfn>, which must be
  initially empty. Whenever a <a>text track cue</a> is added to the <a>list of cues</a> of a
  <a>text track</a> that is in the <a>list of text tracks</a> for a <a>media element</a>, that
  <a>cue</a> must be added to the <a>media element</a>'s <a>list of newly introduced cues</a>.
  Whenever a <a>text track</a> is added to the <a>list of text tracks</a> for a
  <a>media element</a>, all of the <a>cues</a> in that <a>text track</a>'s <a>list of cues</a>
  must be added to the <a>media element</a>'s <a>list of newly introduced cues</a>. When a
  <a>media element</a>'s <a>list of newly introduced cues</a> has new cues added while the
  <a>media element</a>'s <a>show poster flag</a> is not set, then the user agent must
  run the <i>time marches on</i> steps.

  When a <a>text track cue</a> is removed from the <a>list of cues</a> of a <a>text track</a>
  that is in the <a>list of text tracks</a> for a <a>media element</a>, and whenever a
  <a>text track</a> is removed from the <a>list of text tracks</a> of a <a>media element</a>, if
  the <a>media element</a>'s <a>show poster flag</a> is not set, then the user agent must run the
  <i>time marches on</i> steps.

  When the <a>current playback position</a> of a <a>media element</a> changes (e.g.,
  due to playback or seeking), the user agent must run the <i>time marches on</i> steps. If the
  <a>current playback position</a> changes while the steps are running, then the user agent
  must wait for the steps to complete, and then must immediately rerun the steps. (These steps are
  thus run as often as possible or needed — if one iteration takes a long time, this can cause
  certain <a>cues</a> to be skipped over as the user agent rushes ahead
  to "catch up".)

  The <dfn><i>time marches on</i></dfn> steps are as follows:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>current cues</var> be a list of <a>cues</a>, initialized to contain all the
    <a>cues</a> of all the <a mode for="track">hidden</a> or <a mode for="track">showing</a>
    <a>text tracks</a> of the <a>media element</a> (not the disabled ones) whose
    <a>start times</a> are less than or equal to the <a>current playback position</a> and whose
    <a>end times</a> are greater than the <a>current playback position</a>.</li>

    <li>Let <var>other cues</var> be a list of <a>cues</a>, initialized to contain all the
    <a>cues</a> of <a mode for="track">hidden</a> and <a mode for="track">showing</a>
    <a>text tracks</a> of the <a>media element</a> that are not present in
    <var>current cues</var>.</li>

    <li>Let <var>last time</var> be the <a>current playback position</a> at the
    time this algorithm was last run for this <a>media element</a>, if this is not the first
    time it has run.</li>

    <li>If the <a>current playback position</a> has, since the last time this algorithm was
    run, only changed through its usual monotonic increase during normal playback, then let
    <var>missed cues</var> be the list of <a>cues</a> in <var>other cues</var> whose
    <a>start times</a> are greater than or equal to <var>last time</var> and whose
    <a>end times</a> are less than or equal to the <a>current playback position</a>.
    Otherwise, let <var>missed cues</var> be an empty list.</li>

    <li>Remove all the <a>cues</a> in <var>missed cues</var>
    that are also in the <a>media element</a>'s <a>list of newly introduced cues</a>, and
    then empty the element's <a>list of newly introduced cues</a>.</li>

    <li>If the time was reached through the usual monotonic increase of the
    <a>current playback position</a> during normal playback, and if the user agent has not fired
    a <code>timeupdate</code> event at the element in the past 15 to 250ms and
    is not still running event handlers for such an event, then the user agent must
    <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>timeupdate</code> at the
    element. (In the other cases, such as explicit seeks, relevant events get fired as part of
    the overall process of changing the <a>current playback position</a>.)

    <p class="note">
      The event thus is not to be fired faster than about 66Hz or slower than 4Hz
      (assuming the event handlers don't take longer than 250ms to run). User agents are
      encouraged to vary the frequency of the event based on the system load and the average cost
      of processing the event each time, so that the UI updates are not any more frequent than the
      user agent can comfortably handle while decoding the video.
  </li>

    <li>If all of the <a>cues</a> in <var>current cues</var> have their
    <a>text track cue active flag</a> set, none of the <a>cues</a> in <var>other cues</var> have
    their <a>text track cue active flag</a> set, and <var>missed cues</var> is empty, then abort
    these steps.</li>

    <li>

    If the time was reached through the usual monotonic increase of the
    <a>current playback position</a> during normal playback, and there are <a>cues</a>
    in <var>other cues</var> that have their <a>text track cue pause-on-exit flag</a>
    set and that either have their <a>text track cue active flag</a> set or are also in
    <var>missed cues</var>, then <a>immediately</a> <a state for="useragent">pause</a> the
    <a>media element</a>.

    <p class="note">
      In the other cases, such as explicit seeks, playback is not paused by going past
      the end time of a <a>cue</a>, even if that <a>cue</a> has its
      <a>text track cue pause-on-exit flag</a> set.
    </p>

    </li>

    <li>

    Let <var>events</var> be a list of <a>tasks</a>, initially empty. Each <a>task</a> in this
    list will be associated with a <a>text track</a>, a <a>text track cue</a>, and a time, which
    are used to sort the list before the <a>tasks</a> are queued.

    Let <var>affected tracks</var> be a list of <a>text tracks</a>, initially empty.

    When the steps below say to <dfn>prepare an event</dfn> named <var>event</var> for a
    <a>text track cue</a> <var>target</var> with a time <var>time</var>, the
    user agent must run these substeps:

    <ol>

      <li>Let <var>track</var> be the <a>text track</a> with which the <a>text track cue</a>
      <var>target</var> is associated.</li>

      <li>Create a <a>task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named <var>event</var> at
      <var>target</var>.</li>

      <li>Add the newly created <a>task</a> to <var>events</var>, associated with the time
      <var>time</var>, the <a>text track</a> <var>track</var>, and the <a>text track cue</a>
      <var>target</var>.</li>

      <li>Add <var>track</var> to <var>affected tracks</var>.</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    <li>For each <a>text track cue</a> in <var>missed cues</var>, <a>prepare an event</a> named
    <code>enter</code> for the <code>TextTrackCue</code> object with the
    <a>text track cue start time</a>.</li>

    <li>For each <a>text track cue</a> in <var>other cues</var> that either has its
    <a>text track cue active flag</a> set or is in <var>missed cues</var>, <a>prepare an event</a>
    named <code>exit</code> for the <code>TextTrackCue</code> object with the later of the
    <a>text track cue end time</a> and the <a>text track cue start time</a>.</li>

    <li>For each <a>text track cue</a> in <var>current cues</var> that does not have its
    <a>text track cue active flag</a> set, <a>prepare an event</a> named <code>enter</code>
    for the <code>TextTrackCue</code> object with the <a>text track cue start time</a>.</li>

    <li>

    Sort the <a>tasks</a> in <var>events</var> in ascending time order (<a>tasks</a> with
    earlier times first).

    Further sort <a>tasks</a> in <var>events</var> that have the same time by the relative
    <a>text track cue order</a> of the <a>text track cues</a> associated with these <a>tasks</a>.

    Finally, sort <a>tasks</a> in <var>events</var> that have the same time and same
    <a>text track cue order</a> by placing <a>tasks</a> that fire <code>enter</code> events before
    those that fire <code>exit</code> events.

    </li>

    <li><a lt="queue a task">Queue</a> each <a>task</a> in <var>events</var>, in list order.</li>

    <li>Sort <var>affected tracks</var> in the same order as the <a>text tracks</a> appear in the

    <li>For each <a>text track</a> in <var>affected tracks</var>, in the list order,
    <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>cuechange</code> at the
    {{TextTrack}} object, and, if the <a>text track</a> has a corresponding <{track}> element,
    to then <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>cuechange</code> at the <{track}> element
    as well.</li>

    <li>Set the <a>text track cue active flag</a> of all the <a>cues</a> in the
    <var>current cues</var>, and unset the <a>text track cue active flag</a> of all the
    <a>cues</a> in the <var>other cues</var>.</li>

    <li>Run the <a>rules for updating the text track rendering</a> of each of the
    <a>text tracks</a> in <var>affected tracks</var> that are <a mode for="track">showing</a>,
    providing the <a>text track</a>'s <a>text track language</a> as the fallback language if it
    is not the empty string. For example, for <a>text tracks</a> based on WebVTT, the
    <a>rules for updating the display of WebVTT text tracks</a>. [[WEBVTT]]</li>

  </ol>

  For the purposes of the algorithm above, a <a>text track cue</a> is considered to be part
  of a <a>text track</a> only if it is listed in the <a>text track list of cues</a>, not
  merely if it is associated with the <a>text track</a>.

  <p class="note">
    If the <a>media element</a>'s <a>node document</a> stops being a <a>fully active</a> document,
    then the playback will stop until the document is active again.
  </p>

  When a <a>media element</a> is <a>removed from a <code>Document</code></a>, the user agent must
  run the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li><a>Await a stable state</a>, allowing the <a>task</a> that removed the
    <a>media element</a> from the {{Document}} to continue. The <a>synchronous section</a>
    consists of all the remaining steps of this algorithm. (Steps in the
    <a>synchronous section</a> are marked with ⌛.)</li>

    <li>⌛ If the <a>media element</a> is <a>in a <code>Document</code></a>,
    abort these steps.</li>

    <li>⌛ Run the <a>internal pause steps</a> for the <a>media element</a>.

  </li></ol>

<h5 id="seeking">Seeking</h5>

  <dl class="domintro">

    <dt><var>media</var> . <code>seeking</code></dt>

    <dd>

    Returns true if the user agent is currently seeking.

    </dd>

    <dt><var>media</var> . <code>seekable</code></dt>

    <dd>

    Returns a <code>TimeRanges</code> object that represents the ranges of the <a>media

    </dd>

    <dt><var>media</var> . <code>fastSeek</code>( <var>time</var> )</dt>

    <dd>

    Seeks to near the given <var>time</var> as fast as possible, trading precision for
    speed. (To seek to a precise time, use the <code>currentTime</code> attribute.)

    This does nothing if the media resource has not been loaded.

    </dd>

  </dl>

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>seeking</code></dfn> attribute must initially
  have the value false.

  The <dfn method for="HTMLMediaElement" title="fastSeek(time)">fastSeek(double time)</dfn> method
  must <a>seek</a> to the time given by the method's argument, with the
  <i>approximate-for-speed</i> flag set.

  When the user agent is required to <dfn>seek</dfn> to a particular
  <var>new playback position</var> in the <a>media resource</a>, optionally with the
  <i>approximate-for-speed</i> flag set, it means that the user agent must run the following steps.
  This algorithm interacts closely with the <a>event loop</a> mechanism; in particular, it has
  a <a>synchronous section</a> (which is triggered as part of the <a>event loop</a>
  algorithm). Steps in that section are marked with ⌛.

  <ol>

    <li>Set the <a>media element</a>'s <a>show poster flag</a> to false.</li>

    <li>If the <a>media element</a>'s <code>readyState</code>
    is <code>HAVE_NOTHING</code>, abort these steps.</li>

    <li>If the element's <code>seeking</code> IDL attribute is true,
    then another instance of this algorithm is already running. Abort that other instance of the
    algorithm without waiting for the step that it is running to complete.</li>

    <li>Set the <code>seeking</code> IDL attribute to true.</li>

    <li>If the seek was in response to a DOM method call or setting of an IDL attribute, then
    continue the script. The remainder of these steps must be run <a>in parallel</a>. With the
    exception of the steps marked with ⌛, they could be aborted at any time by another instance
    of this algorithm being invoked.</li>

    <li>If the <var>new playback position</var> is later than the end of the <a>media
    resource</a>, then let it be the end of the <a>media resource</a> instead.</li>

    <li>If the <var>new playback position</var> is less than the <a>earliest possible
    position</a>, let it be that position instead.</li>

    <li>If the (possibly now changed) <var>new playback position</var> is not in one of
    the ranges given in the <code>seekable</code> attribute, then let it
    be the position in one of the ranges given in the <code>seekable</code> attribute that is the
    nearest to the <var>new playback position</var>. If two positions both satisfy that constraint
    (i.e., the <var>new playback position</var> is exactly in the middle between two ranges in the
    <code>seekable</code> attribute) then use the position that is closest to
    the <a>current playback position</a>. If there are no ranges given in the
    <code>seekable</code> attribute then set the <code>seeking</code> IDL attribute to false
    and abort these steps.</li>

    <li>

    If the <i>approximate-for-speed</i> flag is set, adjust the <var>new playback
    position</var> to a value that will allow for playback to resume promptly. If <var>new
    playback position</var> before this step is before <a>current playback position</a>, then
    the adjusted <var>new playback position</var> must also be before the <a>current
    playback position</a>. Similarly, if the <var>new playback position</var> before
    this step is after <a>current playback position</a>, then the adjusted <var>new
    playback position</var> must also be after the <a>current playback position</a>.

    <p class="example">
      For example, the user agent could snap to a nearby key frame, so that it doesn't have to
      spend time decoding then discarding intermediate frames before resuming playback.
    </p>

    <li><a>Queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>seeking</code> at the element.</li>

    <p class="note">
      If the <a>media element</a> was <a>potentially playing</a> immediately before it started
      seeking, but seeking caused its <code>readyState</code> attribute to change to a value lower

      <a>fired</a> at the element.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      This step sets the <a>current playback position</a>, and thus can immediately trigger other
      conditions, such as the rules regarding when playback "reaches the end of the

      agent is actually able to render the media data for that position (as determined in the

  <hr />

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>seekable</code></dfn> attribute must return a new
  static <a>normalized <code>TimeRanges</code> object</a> that represents the ranges of the
  <a>media resource</a>, if any, that the user agent is able to seek to, at the time the
  attribute is evaluated.

  <p class="note">
    If the user agent can seek to anywhere in the <a>media resource</a>, e.g., because it is a
    simple movie file and the user agent and the server support HTTP Range requests, then the
    attribute would return an object with one range, whose start is the time of the first
    frame (the <a>earliest possible position</a>, typically zero), and whose end is the
    time of the last frame.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    The range might be continuously changing, e.g., if the user agent is buffering a sliding
    window on an infinite stream. This is the behavior seen with DVRs viewing live TV,
    for instance.
  </p>

  User agents should adopt a very liberal and optimistic view of what is seekable. User
  agents should also buffer recent content where possible to enable seeking to be fast.

  <p class="example">
    For instance, consider a large video file served on an HTTP server without support for
    HTTP Range requests. A browser <em>could</em> implement this by only buffering the current
    frame and data obtained for subsequent frames, never allow seeking, except for seeking to
    the very start by restarting the playback. However, this would be a poor implementation. A high
    quality implementation would buffer the last few minutes of content (or more, if sufficient
    storage space is available), allowing the user to jump back and rewatch something surprising
    without any latency, and would in addition allow arbitrary seeking by reloading the file from
    the start if necessary, which would be slower but still more convenient than having to
    literally restart the video and watch it all the way through just to get to an earlier
    unbuffered spot.
  </p>

  <a>Media resources</a> might be internally scripted or interactive. Thus, a <a>media element</a>
  could play in a non-linear fashion. If this happens, the user agent must act as if the algorithm
  for <a>seeking</a> was used whenever the <a>current playback position</a> changes in a
  discontinuous fashion (so that the relevant events fire).

<h5 id="media-resources-with-multiple-media-tracks">Media resources with multiple media tracks</h5>

  A <a>media resource</a> can have multiple embedded audio and video tracks. For example,
  in addition to the primary video and audio tracks, a <a>media resource</a> could have
  foreign-language dubbed dialogs, director's commentaries, audio descriptions, alternative
  angles, or sign-language overlays.

  An <code>AudioTrackList</code> object represents a dynamic list of zero or more audio tracks,
  of which zero or more can be enabled at a time. Each audio track is represented by an
  <code>AudioTrack</code> object.

  A {{VideoTrackList}} object represents a dynamic list of zero or more video tracks, of
  which zero or one can be selected at a time. Each video track is represented by a
  <code>VideoTrack</code> object.

  Tracks in <code>AudioTrackList</code> and {{VideoTrackList}} objects must be
  consistently ordered. If the <a>media resource</a> is in a format that defines an order,
  then that order must be used; otherwise, the order must be the relative order in which the tracks
  are declared in the <a>media resource</a>. The order used is called the <i>natural order</i>
  of the list.

  <p class="note">
    Each track in one of these objects thus has an index; the first has the index 0, and each
    subsequent track is numbered one higher than the previous one. If a <a>media resource</a>
    dynamically adds or removes audio or video tracks, then the indices of the tracks will change
    dynamically. If the <a>media resource</a> changes entirely, then all the previous tracks will
    be removed and replaced with new tracks.
  </p>

  The <dfn attribute for="AudioTrackList" lt="length"><code>AudioTrackList.length</code></dfn> and
  <dfn attribute for="VideoTrackList" lt="length"><code>VideoTrackList.length</code></dfn>
  attributes must return the number of tracks represented by their objects at the time of getting.

  The <a>supported property indices</a> of <code>AudioTrackList</code> and {{VideoTrackList}}
  objects at any instant are the numbers from zero to the number of tracks represented by the
  respective object minus one, if any tracks are represented. If an <code>AudioTrackList</code>
  or {{VideoTrackList}} object represents no tracks, it has no <a>supported property indices</a>.

  To <a>determine the value of an indexed property</a> for a given index <var>index</var> in an
  <code>AudioTrackList</code> or {{VideoTrackList}} object <var>list</var>, the user agent must
  return the <code>AudioTrack</code> or <code>VideoTrack</code> object that represents the
  <var>index</var>th track in <var>list</var>.

  The
  <dfn method for="AudioTrackList" lt="getTrackById()|getTrackById(id)"><code>AudioTrackList.getTrackById(<var>id</var>)</code></dfn>
  and
  <dfn method for="VideoTrackList" lt="getTrackById()|getTrackById(id)"><code>VideoTrackList.getTrackById(<var>id</var>)</code></dfn>
  methods must return the first {{AudioTrack}} or {{VideoTrack}} object (respectively) in the
  {{AudioTrackList}} or {{VideoTrackList}} object (respectively) whose identifier is equal to the
  value of the <var>id</var> argument (in the natural order of the list, as defined above). When no
  tracks match the given argument, the methods must return null.

  The <code>AudioTrack</code> and <code>VideoTrack</code> objects represent specific tracks of a
  <a>media resource</a>. Each track can have an identifier, category, label, and language.
  These aspects of a track are permanent for the lifetime of the track; even if a track is removed
  from a <a>media resource</a>'s <code>AudioTrackList</code> or <code>VideoTrackList</code>
  objects, those aspects do not change.

  In addition, <code>AudioTrack</code> objects can each be enabled or disabled; this is the audio
  track's <i>enabled state</i>. When an <code>AudioTrack</code> is created, its
  <i>enabled state</i> must be set to false (disabled). The <a>resource fetch algorithm</a>
  can override this.

  Similarly, a single <code>VideoTrack</code> object per {{VideoTrackList}} object can
  be selected, this is the video track's <i>selection state</i>. When a <code>VideoTrack</code> is
  created, its <i>selection state</i> must be set to false (not selected). The <a>resource fetch algorithm</a> can override this.

  The <dfn attribute for="AudioTrack" lt="id"><code>AudioTrack.id</code></dfn> and
  <dfn attribute for="VideoTrack" lt="id"><code>VideoTrack.id</code></dfn> attributes must return
  the identifier of the track, if it has one, or the empty string otherwise. If the
  <a>media resource</a> is in a format that supports the <cite>Media Fragments URI</cite> fragment
  identifier syntax, the identifier returned for a particular track must be the same identifier
  that would enable the track if used as the name of a track in the track dimension of such a
  fragment identifier. [[!MEDIA-FRAGS]] [[INBANDTRACKS]]

  <p class="example">
    For example, in Ogg files, this would be the Name header field of the track. [[!OGGSKELETON]]

  The <dfn attribute for="AudioTrack" lt="kind"><code>AudioTrack.kind</code></dfn> and
  <dfn attribute for="VideoTrack" lt="kind"><code>VideoTrack.kind</code></dfn> attributes must
  return the category of the track, if it has one, or the empty string otherwise.

  The category of a track is the string given in the first column of the table below that is the
  most appropriate for the track based on the definitions in the table's second and third columns,
  as determined by the metadata included in the track in the <a>media resource</a>. The cell
  in the third column of a row says what the category given in the cell in the first column of that
  row applies to; a category is only appropriate for an audio track if it applies to audio tracks,
  and a category is only appropriate for video tracks if it applies to video tracks. Categories
  must only be returned for <code>AudioTrack</code> objects if they are appropriate for audio,
  and must only be returned for <code>VideoTrack</code> objects if they are appropriate for video.

  must return the BCP 47 language tag of the language of the track, if it has one, or the empty
  string otherwise. If the user agent is not able to express that language as a BCP 47 language tag
  (for example because the language information in the <a>media resource</a>'s format is a
  free-form string without a defined interpretation), then the method must return the empty
  string, as if the track had no language.

  Source attribute values for id, kind, label and language of multitrack audio and video tracks as

  The <dfn attribute for="AudioTrack" lt="enabled"><code>AudioTrack.enabled</code></dfn> attribute,
  on getting, must return true if the track is currently enabled, and false otherwise. On setting,
  it must enable the track if the new value is true, and disable it otherwise. (If the track is no
  longer in an {{AudioTrackList}} object, then the track being enabled or disabled has no
  effect beyond changing the value of the attribute on the {{AudioTrack}} object.)

  Whenever an audio track in an <code>AudioTrackList</code> that was disabled is enabled, and
  whenever one that was enabled is disabled, the user agent must <a>queue a task</a> to
  <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>change</code> at the <code>AudioTrackList</code> object.

  An audio track that has no data for a particular position on the <a>media timeline</a>,
  or that does not exist at that position, must be interpreted as being silent at that point on the
  timeline.

  The
  <dfn attribute for="VideoTrackList" lt="selectedIndex"><code>VideoTrackList.selectedIndex</code></dfn>
  attribute must return the index of the currently selected track, if any. If the {{VideoTrackList}}
  object does not currently represent any tracks, or if none of the tracks are selected, it must

  The <dfn attribute for="VideoTrack" lt="selected"><code>VideoTrack.selected</code></dfn>
  attribute, on getting, must return true if the track is currently selected, and false otherwise.
  On setting, it must select the track if the new value is true, and unselect it otherwise. If the

  be unselected. (If the track is no longer in a {{VideoTrackList}} object, then the track
  being selected or unselected has no effect beyond changing the value of the attribute on the
  {{VideoTrack}} object.)

  Whenever a track in a <code>VideoTrackList</code> that was previously not selected is selected,
  and whenever the selected track in a <code>VideoTrackList</code> is unselected without a new
  track being selected in its stead, the user agent must <a>queue a task</a> to
  <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>change</code> at the {{VideoTrackList}} object.
  This <a>task</a> must be <a>queued</a> before the <a>task</a> that fires the
  <code>resize</code> event, if any.

  A video track that has no data for a particular position on the <a>media timeline</a>
  must be interpreted as being fully transparent black at that point on the timeline, with the same
  dimensions as the last frame before that position, or, if the position is before all the data for
  that track, the same dimensions as the first frame for that track. A track that does not exist at
  all at the current position must be treated as if it existed but had no data.

  <p class="example">
    For instance, if a video has a track that is only introduced after one hour of playback, and
    the user selects that track then goes back to the start, then the user agent will act as if
    that track started at the start of the <a>media resource</a> but was simply transparent
    until one hour in.

<h5 id="timed-text-tracks">Timed text tracks</h5>

<h6 id="text-track-model">Text track model</h6>

  A <a>media element</a> can have a group of associated <dfn>text tracks</dfn>, known as the
  <a>media element</a>'s <dfn>list of text tracks</dfn>. The <a>text tracks</a> are sorted
  as follows:

  <ol class="brief">

    <li>The <a>text tracks</a> corresponding to <{track}> element
    children of the <a>media element</a>, in <a>tree order</a>.</li>

    <li>Any <a>text tracks</a> added using the <code>addTextTrack()</code> method, in the order they were added, oldest
    first.</li>

    <li>Any <a>media-resource-specific text
    tracks</a> (<a>text tracks</a> corresponding to data in the
    <a>media resource</a>), in the order defined by the <a>media resource</a>'s format
    specification.</li>

  </ol>

  A <a>text track</a> consists of:

  <dl>

    <dt><dfn lt="kind of track|the kind of text track|kind|text track kind|text track kinds">The kind of text track</dfn>

    </dt><dd>

    This decides how the track is handled by the user agent. The kind is represented by a string.
    The possible strings are:

    <ul class="brief">
      <li><dfn kind for="track"><code>subtitles</code></dfn></li>
      <li><dfn kind for="track"><code>captions</code></dfn></li>
      <li><dfn kind for="track"><code>descriptions</code></dfn></li>
      <li><dfn kind for="track"><code>chapters</code></dfn></li>
      <li><dfn kind for="track"><code>metadata</code></dfn></li>
    </ul>

    The <a>kind of track</a> can change dynamically, in the case of
    a <a>text track</a> corresponding to a <{track}> element.

    </dd>

    <dt><dfn lt="label of a track|text track label|a label">A label</dfn>

    </dt><dd>

    This is a human-readable string intended to identify the track for the user.

    The <a>label of a track</a> can change dynamically, in the
    case of a <a>text track</a> corresponding to a <{track}> element.

    When a <a>text track label</a> is the empty string, the user agent should automatically
    generate an appropriate label from the text track's other properties (e.g., the kind of text
    track and the text track's language) for use in its user interface.
    This automatically-generated label is not exposed in the API.

    </dd>

    <dt><dfn lt="in-band metadata track dispatch type|an in-band metadata track dispatch type|text track in-band metadata track dispatch type">An in-band metadata track dispatch type</dfn>

    </dt><dd>

    This is a string extracted from the <a>media resource</a> specifically for in-band
    metadata tracks to enable such tracks to be dispatched to different scripts in the document.

    <p class="example">For example, a traditional TV station broadcast streamed on the Web and
    augmented with Web-specific interactive features could include text tracks with metadata for ad
    targeting, trivia game data during game shows, player states during sports games, recipe
    information during food programs, and so forth. As each program starts and ends, new tracks
    might be added or removed from the stream, and as each one is added, the user agent could bind
    them to dedicated script modules using the value of this attribute.</p>

  A <dfn lt="cue|cues|text track cue">text track cue</dfn> is the unit of time-sensitive data in a
  <a>text track</a>, corresponding for instance for subtitles and captions to the text that
  appears at a particular time and disappears at another time.

  Each <a>text track cue</a> consists of:

  <dl>

    <dt><dfn lt="text track cue identifier|an identifier">An identifier</dfn>
    </dt><dd>
    An arbitrary string.
    </dd>

    <dt><dfn lt="text track cue start time|a start time">A start time</dfn>
    </dt><dd>
    The time, in seconds and fractions of a second, that describes the beginning of the range of

    </dd>

    <dt><dfn lt="text track cue end time|an end time">An end time</dfn>
    </dt><dd>
    The time, in seconds and fractions of a second, that describes the end of the range of the

    </dd>

    <dt><dfn lt="pause-on-exit flag|pause-on-exit|text track cue pause-on-exit flag">A pause-on-exit flag</dfn>
    </dt><dd>

    </dd>

    <dt><dfn lt="text track cue data">Some additional format-specific data</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
    Additional fields, as needed for the format. For example, WebVTT has a <a>text track cue

    </dd>

    <dt><dfn lt="text track rules for extracting the chapter title|rules for extracting the chapter title">Rules for extracting the chapter title</dfn>
    </dt><dd>
    An algorithm which, when applied to the cue, returns a string that can be used in user

    </dd>

  </dl>

  <p class="note">
    The <a>text track cue start time</a> and <a>text track cue end time</a> can be negative.
    (The <a>current playback position</a> can never be negative, though, so cues entirely before
    time zero cannot be active.)
  </p>

  Each <a>text track cue</a> has a corresponding <code>TextTrackCue</code> object (or more
  specifically, an object that inherits from <code>TextTrackCue</code> — for example, WebVTT
  cues use the <code>VTTCue</code> interface). A <a>text track cue</a>'s in-memory
  representation can be dynamically changed through this <code>TextTrackCue</code> API. [[WEBVTT]]

  A <a>text track cue</a> is associated with <a>rules for updating the text track rendering</a>,
  as defined by the specification for the specific kind of <a>text track cue</a>. These rules are
  used specifically when the object representing the cue is added to a {{TextTrack}} object using
  the <code>addCue()</code> method.

  In addition, each <a>text track cue</a> has two pieces of dynamic information:

  <dl>

    <dt>The <dfn lt="text track cue active flag|active flag">active flag</dfn>
    </dt><dd>

    This flag must be initially unset. The flag is used to ensure events are fired appropriately
    when the cue becomes active or inactive, and to make sure the right cues are rendered.

    The user agent must immediately unset this flag whenever the <a>text track cue</a> is
    removed from its <a>text track</a>'s <a>text track list of cues</a>; whenever the
    <a>text track</a> itself is removed from its <a>media element</a>'s <a>list of text tracks</a>
    or has its <a>text track mode</a> changed to disabled; and whenever the <a>media element</a>'s
    <code>readyState</code> is changed back to <code>HAVE_NOTHING</code>. When the flag is unset
    in this way for one or more cues in <a>text tracks</a> that were
    <a mode for="track">showing</a> prior to the relevant incident, the user agent must, after
    having unset the flag for all the affected cues, apply the <a>rules for updating the text track
    rendering</a> of those <a>text tracks</a>. For example, for <a>text tracks</a> based on
    <a>WebVTT</a>, the <a>rules for updating the display of WebVTT text tracks</a>. [[WEBVTT]] </dd>

    <dt>The <dfn lt="text track cue display state|display state">display state</dfn>
    </dt><dd>

    This is used as part of the rendering model, to keep cues in a consistent position. It must
    initially be empty. Whenever the <a>text track cue active flag</a> is unset, the user
    agent must empty the <a>text track cue display state</a>.

    </dd>

  </dl>

  The <a>text track cues</a> of a <a>media element</a>'s <a>text tracks</a> are ordered relative
  to each other in the <dfn>text track cue order</dfn>, which is determined as follows: first
  group the <a>cues</a> by their <a>text track</a>, with the groups being sorted in the same order
  as their <a>text tracks</a> appear in the <a>media element</a>'s <a>list of text tracks</a>;
  then, within each group, <a>cues</a> must be sorted by their <a>start time</a>, earliest first;
  then, any <a>cues</a> with the same <a>start time</a> must be sorted by their <a>end time</a>,
  latest first; and finally, any <a>cues</a> with identical <a>end times</a> must be sorted in the
  order they were last added to their respective <a>text track list of cues</a>, oldest first (so
  e.g., for cues from a WebVTT file, that would initially be the order in which the cues were
  listed in the file). [[WEBVTT]]

<h6 id="sourcing-inband-text-tracks">Sourcing in-band text tracks</h6>

  A <dfn>media-resource-specific text track</dfn> is a <a>text track</a> that corresponds
  to data found in the <a>media resource</a>.

  Rules for processing and rendering such data are defined by the relevant specifications, e.g.,
  the specification of the video format if the <a>media resource</a> is a video. Details for
  some legacy formats can be found in the <cite>Sourcing In-band Media Resource Tracks from Media
  Containers into HTML</cite> specification. [[INBANDTRACKS]]

  When a <a>media resource</a> contains data that the user agent recognizes and supports as
  being equivalent to a <a>text track</a>, the user agent <a>runs</a> the <dfn>steps to expose a
  media-resource-specific text track</dfn> with the relevant data, as follows.

  <ol>

    <li>Associate the relevant data with a new <a>text track</a> and its corresponding new
    {{TextTrack}} object. The <a>text track</a> is a <a>media-resource-specific text track</a>.
    </li>

    <li>Set the new <a>text track</a>'s <a>kind</a>, <a data-lt="label of a track">label</a>, and
    <a>language</a> based on the semantics of the relevant data, as defined for the relevant
    format [[INBANDTRACKS]]. If there is no label in that data, then the
    <a data-lt="label of a track">label</a> must be set to the empty string.</li>

    <li>Associate the <a>text track list of cues</a> with the <a>rules for updating the
    text track rendering</a> appropriate for the format in question.</li>

    <li>If the new <a>text track</a>'s <a>kind</a> is <code>metadata</code>, then set the
    <a>text track in-band metadata track dispatch type</a> as follows, based on the type of the
    <a>media resource</a>:

    <dl class="switch">

      following the "ES_info_length" field. The <a>text track in-band metadata track dispatch

  When a <{track}> element is created, it must be associated with a new <a>text track</a> (with
  its value set as defined below) and its corresponding new {{TextTrack}} object.

  The <a>text track kind</a> is determined from the state of the element's <code>kind</code>
  attribute according to the following table; for a state given in a cell of the first column,
  the <a>kind</a> is the string given in the second column:

  <table>
    <thead>

  The <a>text track label</a> is the element's <a>track label</a>.

  The <a>text track language</a> is the element's <a>track language</a>, if any, or
  the empty string otherwise.

  As the <code>kind</code>, <code>label</code>, and <code>srclang</code> attributes are set,
  changed, or removed, the <a>text track</a> must update accordingly, as per the definitions above.

  <p class="note">
    Changes to the <a>track URL</a> are handled in the algorithm below.

  The <a>text track readiness state</a> is initially <a state for="track">not loaded</a>, and the

  the <a>rules for updating the display of WebVTT text tracks</a>. [[WEBVTT]]

  When a <{track}> element's parent element changes and the new parent is a <a>media element</a>,

  a <a>trusted</a> event with the name <code>addtrack</code>, that does not bubble and is not

  attribute initialized to the <a>text track</a>'s {{TextTrack}} object, at the
  <a>media element</a>'s <code>textTracks</code> attribute's {{TextTrackList}} object.

  When a <{track}> element's parent element changes and the old parent was a <a>media element</a>,
  then the user agent must remove the <{track}> element's corresponding <a>text track</a> from the
  <a>media element</a>'s <a>list of text tracks</a>, and then <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire</a> a
  <a>trusted</a> event with the name <code>removetrack</code>, that does not bubble and is not

  initialized to the <a>text track</a>'s {{TextTrack}} object, at the <a>media element</a>'s

  <hr />

  When a <a>text track</a> corresponding to a <{track}> element is added to a

  When the user agent is required to
  <dfn>honor user preferences for automatic text track selection</dfn> for a <a>media element</a>,
  the user agent must run the following steps:

  <a>text track kinds</a>, it means to run the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>candidates</var> be a list consisting of the <a>text tracks</a> in the
    <a>media element</a>'s <a>list of text tracks</a> whose <a>text track kind</a> is one of the
    kinds that were passed to the algorithm, if any, in the order given in the
    <a>list of text tracks</a>.</li>

    <li>If <var>candidates</var> is empty, then abort these steps.</li>

    <li>If any of the <a>text tracks</a> in <var>candidates</var> have a <a>text track mode</a> set to <a mode for="track">showing</a>, abort these steps.</li>

    <li>If the user has expressed an interest in having a track from <var>candidates</var>
    enabled based on its <a>text track kind</a>, <a>text track language</a>, and
    <a>text track label</a>, then set its <a>text track mode</a> to
    <a mode for="track">showing</a>.

    <p class="note">
      For example, the user could have set a browser preference to the effect of "I want French
      captions whenever possible", or "If there is a subtitle track with "Commentary" in
      the title, enable it", or "If there are audio description tracks available, enable one,
      ideally in Swiss German, but failing that in Standard Swiss German or Standard German".
    </p>

    Otherwise, if there are any <a>text tracks</a> in <var>candidates</var> that correspond to
    <{track}> elements with a <code>default</code> attribute set whose <a>text track mode</a> is
    set to disabled, then set the <a>text track mode</a> of the first such track to
    <a mode for="track">showing</a>.
    </li>

  </ol>

  When a <a>text track</a> corresponding to a <{track}> element experiences any of
  the following circumstances, the user agent must
  <a>start the <code>track</code> processing model</a> for that <a>text track</a> and its
  <{track}> element:

  <ul>

    <li>The <{track}> element is created.</li>

    <li>The <a>text track</a> has its <a>text track mode</a> changed.</li>

    <li>The <{track}> element's parent element changes and the new parent is a
    <a>media element</a>.</li>

  </ul>

  When a user agent is to <dfn>start the <code>track</code> processing model</dfn> for a
  <a>text track</a> and its <{track}> element, it must run the following algorithm.
  This algorithm interacts closely with the <a>event loop</a> mechanism; in particular, it has
  a <a>synchronous section</a> (which is triggered as part of the <a>event loop</a>
  algorithm). The steps in that section are marked with ⌛.

  <ol>

    <li>If another occurrence of this algorithm is already running for this <a>text track</a> and
    its <{track}> element, abort these steps, letting that other algorithm take care of this
    element.</li>

    <li>If the <a>text track</a>'s <a>text track mode</a> is not set to one of
    <a mode for="track">hidden</a> or <a mode for="track">showing</a>, abort these steps.</li>

    <li>If the <a>text track</a>'s <{track}> element does not have a <a>media element</a> as a
    parent, abort these steps.</li>

    <li>Run the remainder of these steps <a>in parallel</a>, allowing whatever caused these steps
    to run to continue.</li>

    <li><i>Top</i>: <a>Await a stable state</a>. The <a>synchronous section</a> consists of the
    following steps. (The steps in the <a>synchronous section</a> are marked with ⌛.)</li>

    <li>⌛ Set the <a>text track readiness state</a> to <a state for="track">loading</a>.</li>

    <li>⌛ Let <var>URL</var> be the <a>track URL</a> of the <{track}> element.</li>

    <li>⌛ If the <{track}> element's parent is a <a>media element</a> then
    let <var>corsAttributeState</var> be the state of the parent <a>media element</a>'s
    <code>crossorigin</code> content attribute. Otherwise, let
    <var>corsAttributeState</var> be <a state for="cors">No CORS</a>.</li>

    <li>End the <a>synchronous section</a>, continuing the remaining steps <a>in parallel</a>.</li>

    <li>

    If <var>URL</var> is not the empty string, run these substeps:

    <ol>
      <li>Let <var>request</var> be the result of <a>creating a potential-CORS request</a> given
      <var>URL</var>, <var>corsAttributeState</var>, and with the <i>same-origin fallback flag</i>
      set.</li>

      <li>Set <var>request</var>'s <a>client</a> to the <{track}> element's <a>node document</a>'s
      <code>Window</code> object's <a>environment settings object</a> and
      <a for="request">type</a> to "<code>track</code>".</li>

      <li><a>Fetch</a> <var>request</var>.</li>
    </ol>

    The <a>tasks</a> <a>queued</a> by the <a>fetching algorithm</a> on the
    <a>networking task source</a> to process the data as it is being fetched must determine the
    type of the resource. If the type of the resource is not a supported text track format, the
    load will fail, as described below. Otherwise, the resource's data must be passed to the
    appropriate parser (e.g., the <a>WebVTT parser</a>) as it is received, with the
    <a>text track list of cues</a> being used for that parser's output. [[WEBVTT]]

    <p class="note">
      The appropriate parser will incrementally update the <a>text track list of cues</a> during
      these <a>networking task source</a> <a>tasks</a>, as each such task is run with whatever
      data has been received from the network).
    </p>

    <p class="critical">
      This specification does not currently say whether or how to check the MIME types of text
      tracks, or whether or how to perform file type sniffing using the actual file data.
      Implementors differ in their intentions on this matter and it is therefore unclear what
      the right solution is. In the absence of any requirement here, the HTTP specification's
      strict requirement to follow the Content-Type header prevails ("Content-Type specifies the
      media type of the underlying data." ... "If and only if the media type is not given by a
      Content-Type field, the recipient MAY attempt to guess the media type via inspection of its
      content and/or the name extension(s) of the URI used to identify the resource.").
    </p>

    If the <a>fetching algorithm</a> fails for any reason (network error, the server returns an
    error code, a cross-origin check fails, etc), or if <var>URL</var> is the empty string, then
    <a>queue a task</a> to first change the <a>text track readiness state</a> to
    <a state for="track">failed to load</a> and then <a>fire a simple event</a> named
    <code>error</code> at the <{track}> element. This <a>task</a> must use the
    <a>DOM manipulation task source</a>.

    If the <a>fetching algorithm</a> does not fail, but the type of the resource is not a
    supported text track format, or the file was not successfully processed (e.g., the format in
    question is an XML format and the file contained a well-formedness error that the XML
    specification requires be detected and reported to the application), then the <a>task</a> that
    is <a>queued</a> by the <a>networking task source</a> in which the aforementioned problem is
    found must change the <a>text track readiness state</a> to
    <a state for="track">failed to load</a> and <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>error</code>
    at the <{track}> element.

    If the <a>fetching algorithm</a> does not fail, and the file was successfully processed, then
    the final <a>task</a> that is <a>queued</a> by the <a>networking task source</a>, after it has
    finished parsing the data, must change the <a>text track readiness state</a> to
    <a state for="track">loaded</a>, and <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>load</code> at the
    <{track}> element.

    If, while fetching is ongoing, either:

    <ul>

      <li>the <a>track URL</a> changes so that it is no longer equal to <var>URL</var>, while the
      <a>text track mode</a> is set to <a mode for="track">hidden</a> or
      <a mode for="track">showing</a>; or</li>

      <li>the <a>text track mode</a> changes to <a mode for="track">hidden</a>
      or <a mode for="track">showing</a>, while the <a>track URL</a> is not
      equal to <var>URL</var></li>

    </ul>

    ...then the user agent must abort <a>fetching</a>, discarding any pending <a>tasks</a>
    generated by that algorithm (and in particular, not adding any cues to the
    <a>text track list of cues</a> after the moment the URL changed), and then <a>queue a task</a>
    that first changes the <a>text track readiness state</a> to
    <a state for="track">failed to load</a> and then <a>fires a simple event</a> named
    <code>error</code> at the <{track}> element. This <a>task</a> must use the
    <a>DOM manipulation task source</a>.

    </li>

    <li>Wait until the <a>text track readiness state</a> is no longer set to
    <a state for="track">loading</a>.</li>

    <li>Wait until the <a>track URL</a> is no longer equal to <var>URL</var>, at
    the same time as the <a>text track mode</a> is set to <a mode for="track">hidden</a> or
    <a mode for="track">showing</a>.</li>

    <li>Jump to the step labeled <i>top</i>.</li>

  </ol>

  Whenever a <{track}> element has its <code>src</code> attribute set, changed, or removed, the
  user agent must <a>immediately</a> empty the element's <a>text track</a>'s <a>text track list of
  cues</a>. (This also causes the algorithm above to stop adding cues from the resource being
  obtained using the previously given URL, if any.)

<h6 id="guidelines-for-exposing-cues-in-various-formats-as-text-track-cues"><dfn>Guidelines for exposing cues</dfn> in various formats as <a>text track cues</a></h6>

  How a specific format's text track cues are to be interpreted for the purposes of processing by
  an HTML user agent is defined by that format [[INBANDTRACKS]]. In the absence of such a
  specification, this section provides some constraints within which implementations can
  attempt to consistently expose such formats.

  To support the <a>text track</a> model of HTML, each unit of timed data is converted to a
  <a>text track cue</a>. Where the mapping of the format's features to the aspects of a
  <a>text track cue</a> as defined in this specification are not defined, implementations must
  ensure that the mapping is consistent with the definitions of the aspects of a
  <a>text track cue</a> as defined above, as well as with the following constraints:

  <dl>

    <dt>The <a>text track cue identifier</a>
    </dt><dd>
    Should be set to the empty string if the format has no obvious analog to a per-cue identifier.
    </dd>

    <dt>The <a>text track cue pause-on-exit flag</a>
    </dt><dd>
    Should be set to false.
    </dd>

  </dl>

    For <a>media-resource-specific text tracks</a> of <a>kind</a> <code>metadata</code>,
    <a>text track cues</a> are exposed using the <code>DataCue</code> object
    unless there is a more appropriate <code>TextTrackCue</code> interface available.
    For example, if the <a>media-resource-specific text track</a> format is <a>WebVTT</a>,
    then <code>VTTCue</code> is more appropriate.

<h6 id="text-tracks-describing-chapters">Text tracks describing chapters</h6>

  Chapters are segments of a <a>media resource</a> with a given title. Chapters can be
  nested, in the same way that sections in a document outline can have subsections.

  Each <a>text track cue</a> in a <a>text track</a> being used for describing
  chapters has three key features: the <a>text track cue start time</a>, giving the start time
  of the chapter, the <a>text track cue end time</a>, giving the end time of the chapter, and
  the <a>text track rules for extracting the chapter title</a>.

  The <dfn>rules for constructing the chapter tree from a text track</dfn> are as follows. They
  produce a potentially nested list of chapters, each of which have a start time, end time, title,
  and a list of nested chapters. This algorithm discards cues that do not correctly nest within each
  other, or that are out of order.

<h6 id="best-practices-for-metadata-text-tracks">Best practices for metadata text tracks</h6>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  Text tracks can be used for storing data relating to the media data, for interactive or
  augmented views.

  For example, a page showing a sports broadcast could include information about the current
  score. Suppose a robotics competition was being streamed live. The image could be overlayed with
  the scores, as follows:

  <iframe src="images/robots.html" width="600" height="400"></iframe>

  In order to make the score display render correctly whenever the user seeks to an arbitrary
  point in the video, the metadata text track cues need to be as long as is appropriate for the
  score. For example, in the frame above, there would be maybe one cue that lasts the length of the
  match that gives the match number, one cue that lasts until the blue alliance's score changes, and
  one cue that lasts until the red alliance's score changes. If the video is just a stream of the
  live event, the time in the bottom right would presumably be automatically derived from the
  current video time, rather than based on a cue. However, if the video was just the highlights,
  then that might be given in cues also.

  The following shows what fragments of this could look like in a WebVTT file:

  <pre>WEBVTT

...

05:10:00.000 --&gt; 05:12:15.000
matchtype:qual
matchnumber:37

...

05:11:02.251 --&gt; 05:11:17.198
red:78

05:11:03.672 --&gt; 05:11:54.198
blue:66

05:11:17.198 --&gt; 05:11:25.912
red:80

05:11:25.912 --&gt; 05:11:26.522
red:83

05:11:26.522 --&gt; 05:11:26.982
red:86

05:11:26.982 --&gt; 05:11:27.499
red:89

...</pre>

  The key here is to notice that the information is given in cues that span the length of time to
  which the relevant event applies. If, instead, the scores were given as zero-length (or very
  brief, nearly zero-length) cues when the score changes, for example saying "red+2" at
  05:11:17.198, "red+3" at 05:11:25.912, etc, problems arise: primarily, seeking is much harder to
  implement, as the script has to walk the entire list of cues to make sure that no notifications
  have been missed; but also, if the cues are short it's possible the script will never see that
  they are active unless it listens to them specifically.

  When using cues in this manner, authors are encouraged to use the <code>cuechange</code> event
  to update the current annotations. (In particular, using the <code>timeupdate</code> event
  would be less appropriate as it would require doing work even when the cues haven't changed,
  and, more importantly, would introduce a higher latency between when the metadata cues become
  active and when the display is updated, since <code>timeupdate</code> events are rate-limited.)

<h5 id="identifying-a-track-kind-through-a-url">Identifying a track kind through a URL</h5>

  Other specifications or formats that need a <span>URL</span> to identify the return values of
  the <code data-x="dom-AudioTrack-kind">AudioTrack.kind</code> or <code
  data-x="dom-VideoTrack-kind">VideoTrack.kind</code> IDL attributes, or identify the <span
  data-x="text track kind">kind of text track</span>, must use the <code>about:html-kind</code>
  <span>URL</span>.

<h5 id="user-interface">User interface</h5>

  The <dfn element-attr for="mediaelements,video,audio"><code>controls</code></dfn> attribute is a
  <a>boolean attribute</a>. If present, it indicates that the author has not provided a scripted
  controller and would like the user agent to provide its own set of controls.

  If the attribute is present, or if <a>scripting is
  disabled</a> for the <a>media element</a>, then the user agent should <dfn lt="exposing a user interface|expose a user interface to the user|exposes a user interface to the user|exposing a user interface to the user|controls in the user interface that is exposed to the user">expose a user interface to the user</dfn>. This user interface should include features to begin playback, pause
  playback, seek to an arbitrary position in the content (if the content supports arbitrary
  seeking), change the volume, change the display of closed captions or embedded sign-language
  tracks, select different audio tracks or turn on audio descriptions, and show the media content in
  manners more suitable to the user (e.g., fullscreen video or in an independent resizable window).
  Other controls may also be made available.

  Even when the attribute is absent, however, user agents may provide controls to affect playback
  of the media resource (e.g., play, pause, seeking, track selection, and volume controls), but
  such features should not interfere with the page's normal rendering. For example, such features
  could be exposed in the <a>media element</a>'s platform media keys, or a remote
  control. The user agent may implement this simply by <a>exposing a user interface to the user</a>
  as described above (as if the <{mediaelements/controls}> attribute was present).

  If the user agent <a>exposes a user interface to
  the user</a> by displaying controls over the <a>media element</a>, then the user agent
  should suppress any user interaction events while the user agent is interacting with this
  interface. (For example, if the user clicks on a video's playback control, <code>mousedown</code>
  events and so forth would not simultaneously be fired at elements on the page.)

  Where possible (specifically, for starting, stopping, pausing, and unpausing playback, for
  seeking, for changing the rate of playback, for fast-forwarding or rewinding, for listing,
  enabling, and disabling text tracks, and for muting or changing the volume of the audio), user
  interface features exposed by the user agent must be implemented in terms of the DOM API described
  above, so that, e.g., all the same events fire.

  For the purposes of listing chapters in the <a>media resource</a>, only <a>text tracks</a> in the
  <a>media element</a>'s <a>list of text tracks</a> that are <a mode for="track">showing</a> and
  whose <a>text track kind</a> is <code>chapters</code> should be used. Such tracks must be
  interpreted according to the <a>rules for constructing the chapter tree from a text
  track</a>. When seeking in response to a user manipulating a chapter selection interface, user
  agents should not use the <i>approximate-for-speed</i> flag.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>controls</code></dfn> IDL attribute must
  <a>reflect</a> the content attribute of the same name.

  <hr />

  <dl class="domintro">

    <dt><var>media</var> . <code>volume</code> [ = <var>value</var> ]</dt>

    <dd>

    Returns the current playback volume, as a number in the range 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 is the
    quietest and 1.0 the loudest.

    Can be set, to change the volume.

    Throws an {{IndexSizeError}} exception if the new value is not in the range 0.0 .. 1.0.

    </dd>

    <dt><var>media</var> . <code>muted</code> [ = <var>value</var> ]</dt>

    <dd>

    Returns true if audio is muted, overriding the <code>volume</code>
    attribute, and false if the <code>volume</code> attribute is being
    honored.

    Can be set, to change whether the audio is muted or not.

    </dd>

  </dl>

  A <a>media element</a> has a <dfn>playback volume</dfn>, which is a fraction in the range 0.0 (silent) to 1.0 (loudest).
  Initially, the volume should be 1.0, but user agents may remember the last set value across
  sessions, on a per-site basis or otherwise, so the volume may start at other values.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>volume</code></dfn> IDL attribute must return the
  <a>playback volume</a> of any audio portions of the
  <a>media element</a>. On setting, if the new value is in the range 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive, the
  <a>media element</a>'s <a>playback volume</a> must be
  set to the new value. If the new value is outside the range 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive, then, on
  setting, an {{IndexSizeError}} exception must be thrown instead.

  A <a>media element</a> can also be <dfn>muted</dfn>. If
  anything is muting the element, then it is muted. (For example, when the <a>direction of
  playback</a> is backwards, the element is muted.)

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>muted</code></dfn> IDL attribute must return the value
  to which it was last set. When a <a>media element</a> is created, if the element has a <code>muted</code> content attribute specified, then the <code>muted</code> IDL attribute should be set to true; otherwise, the user
  agents may set the value to the user's preferred value (e.g., remembering the last set value across
  sessions, on a per-site basis or otherwise). While the <code>muted</code>
  IDL attribute is set to true, the <a>media element</a> must be <a>muted</a>.

  Whenever either of the values that would be returned by the <code>volume</code> and <code>muted</code> IDL
  attributes change, the user agent must <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple
  event</a> named <code>volumechange</code> at the <a>media element</a>.

  An element's <dfn>effective media volume</dfn> is determined as follows:

  <ol>

    <li>If the user has indicated that the user agent is to override the volume of the element,
    then the element's <a>effective media volume</a> is the volume desired by the user. Abort
    these steps.</li>

    <li>If the element's audio output is <a>muted</a>, the
    element's <a>effective media volume</a> is zero. Abort these steps.</li>

    <li>Let <var>volume</var> be the <a>playback
    volume</a> of the audio portions of the <a>media element</a>, in range 0.0 (silent) to
    1.0 (loudest).</li>

    <li>The element's <a>effective media volume</a> is <var>volume</var>,
    interpreted relative to the range 0.0 to 1.0, with 0.0 being silent, and 1.0 being the loudest
    setting, values in between increasing in loudness. The range need not be linear. The loudest
    setting may be lower than the system's loudest possible setting; for example the user could have
    set a maximum volume.</li>

  </ol>

  The <dfn element-attr for="media"><code>muted</code></dfn> content attribute on <a>media elements</a> is a <a>boolean attribute</a> that controls the
  default state of the audio output of the <a>media resource</a>, potentially overriding user
  preferences.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLMediaElement"><code>defaultMuted</code></dfn> IDL attribute must
  <a>reflect</a> the <{media/muted}> content attribute.

  <p class="note">
    This attribute has no dynamic effect (it only controls the default state of the
  element).
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    This video (an advertisement) autoplays, but to avoid annoying users, it does so without
    sound, and allows the user to turn the sound on.

<h5 id="time-ranges">Time ranges</h5>

  Objects implementing the <code>TimeRanges</code> interface
  represent a list of ranges (periods) of time.

  <pre class="idl" data-highlight="webidl">
    interface TimeRanges {
      readonly attribute unsigned long length;
      double start(unsigned long index);
      double end(unsigned long index);

  <dl class="domintro">

    <dt><var>media</var> . <code>length</code></dt>

    <dd>

    Returns the number of ranges in the object.

    </dd>

    <dt><var>time</var> = <var>media</var> . <code>start</code>(<var>index</var>)</dt>

    <dd>

    Returns the time for the start of the range with the given index.

    Throws an {{IndexSizeError}} exception if the index is out of range.

    </dd>

    <dt><var>time</var> = <var>media</var> . <code>end</code>(<var>index</var>)</dt>

    <dd>

    Returns the time for the end of the range with the given index.

    Throws an {{IndexSizeError}} exception if the index is out of range.

    </dd>

  </dl>

  The <dfn attribute for="TimeRanges"><code>length</code></dfn> IDL attribute must return the
  number of ranges represented by the object.

  The <dfn method for="TimeRanges"><code>start(<var>index</var>)</code></dfn>
  method must return the position of the start of the <var>index</var>th range represented
  by the object, in seconds measured from the start of the timeline that the object covers.

  The <dfn method for="TimeRanges"><code>end(<var>index</var>)</code></dfn> method
  must return the position of the end of the <var>index</var>th range represented by the
  object, in seconds measured from the start of the timeline that the object covers.

  These methods must throw {{IndexSizeError}} exceptions if called with an <var>index</var> argument greater than or equal to the number of ranges represented by the
  object.

  When a <code>TimeRanges</code> object is said to be a <dfn>normalized <code>TimeRanges</code>
  object</dfn>, the ranges it represents must obey the following criteria:

  <ul>

    <li>The start of a range must be greater than the end of all earlier ranges.</li>

    <li>The start of a range must be less than or equal to the end of that same range.</li>

  </ul>

  In other words, the ranges in such an object are ordered, don't overlap, and don't touch
  (adjacent ranges are folded into one bigger range). A range can be empty (referencing just a
  single moment in time), e.g., to indicate that only one frame is currently buffered in the case
  that the user agent has discarded the entire <a>media resource</a> except for the current
  frame, when a <a>media element</a> is paused.

  Ranges in a <code>TimeRanges</code> object must be inclusive.

  <p class="example">Thus, the end of a range would be equal to the start of a following adjacent
  (touching but not overlapping) range. Similarly, a range covering a whole timeline anchored at
  zero would have a start equal to zero and an end equal to the duration of the timeline.</p>

  The timelines used by the objects returned by the <code>buffered</code>, <code>seekable</code> and
  <code>played</code> IDL attributes of <a>media elements</a> must be that element's <a>media timeline</a>.

<h5 id="security-and-privacy-considerations">Security and privacy considerations</h5>

  The main security and privacy implications of the <code>video</code> and <code>audio</code>
  elements come from the ability to embed media cross-origin. There are two directions that threats
  can flow: from hostile content to a victim page, and from a hostile page to victim content.

  <hr />

  If a victim page embeds hostile content, the threat is that the content might contain scripted
  code that attempts to interact with the {{Document}} that embeds the content. To avoid
  this, user agents must ensure that there is no access from the content to the embedding page. In
  the case of media content that uses DOM concepts, the embedded content must be treated as if it
  was in its own unrelated <a>top-level browsing context</a>.

  <p class="example">For instance, if an SVG animation was embedded in a <{video}> element,
  the user agent would not give it access to the DOM of the outer page. From the perspective of
  scripts in the SVG resource, the SVG file would appear to be in a lone top-level browsing context
  with no parent.</p>

  <hr />

  If a hostile page embeds victim content, the threat is that the embedding page could obtain
  information from the content that it would not otherwise have access to. The API does expose some
  information: the existence of the media, its type, its duration, its size, and the performance
  characteristics of its host. Such information is already potentially problematic, but in practice
  the same information can be obtained using the <{img}> element, and so it has been deemed
  acceptable.

  However, significantly more sensitive information could be obtained if the user agent further
  exposes metadata within the content such as subtitles or chapter titles. Such information is
  therefore only exposed if the video resource passes a CORS resource sharing check.
  The <code>crossorigin</code> attribute allows authors to control
  how this check is performed. [[!FETCH]]

  <p class="example">Without this restriction, an attacker could trick a user running within a
  corporate network into visiting a site that attempts to load a video from a previously leaked
  location on the corporation's intranet. If such a video included confidential plans for a new
  product, then being able to read the subtitles would present a serious confidentiality breach.</p>

<h5 id="best-practices-for-authors-using-media-elements">Best practices for authors using media elements</h5>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  Playing audio and video resources on small devices such as set-top boxes or mobile phones is
  often constrained by limited hardware resources in the device. For example, a device might only
  support three simultaneous videos. For this reason, it is a good practice to release resources
  held by <a>media elements</a> when they are done playing, either by
  being very careful about removing all references to the element and allowing it to be garbage
  collected, or, even better, by removing the element's <code>src</code>
  attribute and any <{source}> element descendants, and invoking the element's <code>load()</code> method.

  Similarly, when the playback rate is not exactly 1.0, hardware, software, or format limitations
  can cause video frames to be dropped and audio to be choppy or muted.

<h5 id="best-practices-for-implementors-of-media-elements">Best practices for implementors of media elements</h5>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  How accurately various aspects of the <a>media element</a> API are implemented is
  considered a quality-of-implementation issue.

  For example, when implementing the <code>buffered</code> attribute,
  how precise an implementation reports the ranges that have been buffered depends on how carefully
  the user agent inspects the data. Since the API reports ranges as times, but the data is obtained
  in byte streams, a user agent receiving a variable-bit-rate stream might only be able to determine
  precise times by actually decoding all of the data. User agents aren't required to do this,
  however; they can instead return estimates (e.g., based on the average bitrate seen so far) which
  get revised as more information becomes available.

  As a general rule, user agents are urged to be conservative rather than optimistic. For
  example, it would be bad to report that everything had been buffered when it had not.

  Another quality-of-implementation issue would be playing a video backwards when the codec is
  designed only for forward playback (e.g., there aren't many key frames, and they are far apart, and
  the intervening frames only have deltas from the previous frame). User agents could do a poor job,
  e.g., only showing key frames; however, better implementations would do more work and thus do a
  better job, e.g., actually decoding parts of the video forwards, storing the complete frames, and
  then playing the frames backwards.

  Similarly, while implementations are allowed to drop buffered data at any time (there is no
  requirement that a user agent keep all the media data obtained for the lifetime of the media
  element), it is again a quality of implementation issue: user agents with sufficient resources to
  keep all the data around are encouraged to do so, as this allows for a better user experience. For
  example, if the user is watching a live stream, a user agent could allow the user only to view the
  live video; however, a better user agent would buffer everything and allow the user to seek
  through the earlier material, pause it, play it forwards and backwards, etc.

  <hr />

  When a <a>media element</a> that is paused is <a for="document">removed from a document</a> and not reinserted before the next time the <a>event loop</a> reaches step 1, implementations that are resource constrained are encouraged to take
  that opportunity to release all hardware resources (like video planes, networking resources, and
  data buffers) used by the <a>media element</a>. (User agents still have to keep track of the
  playback position and so forth, though, in case playback is later restarted.)

  The <{area}> element <a>represents</a> either a hyperlink with some text and a
  corresponding area on an <a>image map</a>, or a dead area on an image map.

  An <{area}> element with a parent node must have a <{map}> element ancestor
  or a <{template}> element ancestor.

  If the <{area}> element has an <code>href</code>
  attribute, then the <{area}> element represents a <a>hyperlink</a>. In this case,
  the <dfn element-attr for="area"><code>alt</code></dfn> attribute must be present. It specifies the
  text of the hyperlink. Its value must be text that informs the user about the destination of the link.

  If the <{area}> element has no <code>href</code>
  attribute, then the area represented by the element cannot be selected, and the <code>alt</code> attribute must be omitted.

  In both cases, the <code>shape</code> and <code>coords</code> attributes specify the area.

  The <dfn element-attr for="area"><code>shape</code></dfn> attribute is an <a>enumerated
  attribute</a>. The following table lists the keywords defined for this attribute. The states
  given in the first cell of the rows with keywords give the states to which those keywords map.
  Some of the keywords are non-conforming, as noted in the last column.

      </td><td>Non-conforming
  </td></tr></tbody></table>

  The attribute may be omitted. The <i>missing value default</i> is the <a state for="area">rectangle state</a>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="area"><code>coords</code></dfn> attribute must, if specified,
  contain a <a>valid list of floating-point numbers</a>. This attribute gives the coordinates for the shape
  described by the <code>shape</code> attribute.
  The processing for this attribute is described as part of the <a>image map</a> processing model.

  In the <dfn state for="area" lt="Circle state|circle state">circle state</dfn>, <{area}> elements must
  have a <code>coords</code> attribute present, with three integers, the
  last of which must be non-negative. The first integer must be the distance in CSS pixels from the
  left edge of the image to the center of the circle, the second integer must be the distance in CSS
  pixels from the top edge of the image to the center of the circle, and the third integer must be
  the radius of the circle, again in CSS pixels.

  In the <dfn state for="area" lt="Default state|default state">default state</dfn> state, <{area}>
  elements must not have a <code>coords</code> attribute. (The area is the
  whole image.)

  In the <dfn state for="area" lt="Polygon state|polygon state">polygon state</dfn>, <{area}> elements must
  have a <code>coords</code> attribute with at least six integers, and the
  number of integers must be even. Each pair of integers must represent a coordinate given as the
  distances from the left and the top of the image in CSS pixels respectively, and all the
  coordinates together must represent the points of the polygon, in order.

  In the <dfn state for="area" lt="Rectangle state|rectangle state|Rect state|rect state">rectangle state</dfn>, <{area}> elements must
  have a <code>coords</code> attribute with exactly four integers, the
  first of which must be less than the third, and the second of which must be less than the fourth.
  The four points must represent, respectively, the distance from the left edge of the image to the
  left side of the rectangle, the distance from the top edge to the top side, the distance from the
  left edge to the right side, and the distance from the top edge to the bottom side, all in CSS
  pixels.

  When user agents allow users to <a>follow hyperlinks</a> or
  <a>download hyperlinks</a> created using the
  <{area}> element, as described in the next section, the <code>href</code>, <code>target</code>,
  and <code>download</code> attributes decide how the link is followed. The <{area/rel}>, and <code>hreflang</code> attributes may be used to indicate to the user the likely nature of the target resource before the user follows the link.

  The <code>target</code>, <code>download</code>, <{area/rel}>, <code>hreflang</code>,
  <code>type</code>, and <code>referrerpolicy</code> attributes must be omitted if the
  <code>href</code> attribute is not present.

  The <a>activation behavior</a> of <{area}> elements is to run the following
  steps:

  <ol>

    <li>If the <{area}> element's <a>node document</a> is not <a>fully active</a>,
    then abort these steps.</li>

    <li>

    If the <{area}> element has a <code>download</code>
    attribute and the algorithm is not <a>allowed to show a popup</a>; or, if the user has not indicated a specific <a>browsing context</a> for following the link, and the element's <code>target</code> attribute is present, and applying <a>the rules
    for choosing a browsing context given a browsing context name</a>, using the value of the
    <code>target</code> attribute as the browsing context name, would
    result in there not being a chosen browsing context, then run these substeps:

    <ol>

      <li>If there is an <a>entry settings object</a>, throw an
      {{InvalidAccessError}} exception.</li>

      <li>Abort these steps without following the hyperlink.</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    <li>Otherwise, the user agent must <a>follow the
    hyperlink</a> or <a>download the hyperlink</a> created
    by the <{area}> element, if any, and as determined by the <code>download</code> attribute and any expressed user
    preference.</li>

  </ol>

  The IDL attributes <dfn attribute for="HTMLAreaElement"><code>alt</code></dfn>, <dfn attribute for="HTMLAreaElement"><code>coords</code></dfn>, <dfn attribute for="HTMLAreaElement"><code>target</code></dfn>, <dfn attribute for="HTMLAreaElement"><code>download</code></dfn>,
  <dfn attribute for="HTMLAreaElement"><code>rel</code></dfn>, and <dfn attribute for="HTMLAreaElement"><code>hreflang</code></dfn>, each must <a>reflect</a> the respective
  content attributes of the same name.

  The IDL attribute <dfn attribute for="HTMLAreaElement"><code>shape</code></dfn> must
  <a>reflect</a> the <{area/shape}> content attribute.

  The IDL attribute <dfn attribute for="HTMLAreaElement"><code>relList</code></dfn> must
  <a>reflect</a> the <{links/rel}> content attribute.

  The IDL attribute <dfn attribute for="HTMLAreaElement"><code>referrerPolicy</code></dfn> must
  <a>reflect</a> the <{link/referrerpolicy}> content attribute, <a>limited to only known values</a>.

  <hr />

  The <{area}> element also supports the <code>HTMLHyperlinkElementUtils</code> interface. [[!URL]]

  When the element is created, and whenever the element's <code>href</code> content attribute is set, changed, or removed, the user
  agent must invoke the element's <code>HTMLHyperlinkElementUtils</code> interface's set the input algorithm with the value of the <code>href</code> content attribute, if any, or the empty string otherwise,
  as the given value.

  The element's <code>HTMLHyperlinkElementUtils</code> interface's get the base algorithm must simply return the <a>document base URL</a>.

  The element's <code>HTMLHyperlinkElementUtils</code> interface's query encoding is the <a>document's character encoding</a>.

  When the element's <code>HTMLHyperlinkElementUtils</code> interface invokes its update steps with a string <var>value</var>, the user
  agent must set the element's <code>href</code> content attribute to
  the string <var>value</var>.

<h4 id="embedded-content-image-maps">Image maps</h4>

<h5 id="authoring">Authoring</h5>

  An <dfn lt="image map|image maps">image map</dfn> allows geometric areas on an image to be associated with <a>hyperlinks</a>.

  An image, in the form of an <{img}> element, may be associated with an image map (in the form of a <code>map</code>
  element) by specifying a <dfn element-attr for="common"><code>usemap</code></dfn> attribute on
  the <{img}> element. The <code>usemap</code> attribute, if specified, must be a <a>valid
  hash-name reference</a> to a <{map}> element.

  <div class="example">
    Consider an image that looks as follows:

    <img src="images/sample-usemap.png" width="600" height="150" alt="A line with four shapes in it, equally spaced: a red hollow box, a green circle, a blue triangle, and a yellow four-pointed star." />

    If we wanted just the colored areas to be clickable, we could do it as follows:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <p>
        Please select a shape:
        <img src="shapes.png" usemap="#shapes" alt="Four shapes are available: a red hollow box, a green circle, a blue triangle, and a yellow four-pointed star.">
        <map name="shapes">
          <area shape="rect" coords="50,50,100,100"> <!-- the hole in the red box -->
          <area shape="rect" coords="25,25,125,125" href="red.html" alt="Red box.">
          <area shape="circle" coords="200,75,50" href="green.html" alt="Green circle.">
          <area shape="poly" coords="325,25,262,125,388,125" href="blue.html" alt="Blue triangle.">
          <area shape="poly" coords="450,25,435,60,400,75,435,90,450,125,465,90,500,75,465,60" href="yellow.html" alt="Yellow star.">
        </map>
      </p>
    </xmp>

  </div>

<h5 id="image-maps-processing-model">Processing model</h5>

  If an <{img}> element has a
  <code>usemap</code> attribute specified, user agents must process it
  as follows:

  <ol>

    <li>Parse the attribute's value using the <a>rules for parsing a hash-name reference</a> to a <{map}> element, with the element's <a>node document</a> as the context node.
    This will return either an element (the <var>map</var>) or
    null.</li>

    <li>If that returned null, then abort these steps. The image is not associated with an image
    map after all.</li>

    <li>Otherwise, the user agent must collect all the <{area}> elements that are
    descendants of the <var>map</var>. Let those be the <var>areas</var>.</li>

  </ol>

  Having obtained the list of <{area}> elements that form the image map (the <var>areas</var>), interactive user agents must process the list in one of two ways.

  If the user agent intends to show the text that the <{img}> element represents, then
  it must use the following steps.

  <p class="note">
    In user agents that do not support images, or that have images disabled,
    <{object}> elements cannot represent images, and thus this section never applies (the
    <a>fallback content</a> is shown instead). The following steps therefore only apply to
    <{img}> elements.
  </p>

  <ol>

    <li>Remove all the <{area}> elements in <var>areas</var> that have no <code>href</code> attribute.</li>

    <li>Remove all the <{area}> elements in <var>areas</var> that have no <code>alt</code> attribute, or whose <code>alt</code>
    attribute's value is the empty string, <em>if</em> there is another <{area}> element in
    <var>areas</var> with the same value in the <code>href</code> attribute and with a non-empty <code>alt</code> attribute.</li>

    <li>Each remaining <{area}> element in <var>areas</var> represents a
    <a>hyperlink</a>. Those hyperlinks should all be made available to the user in a manner
    associated with the text of the <{img}>.

    In this context, user agents may represent <code>area</code> and <{img}> elements
    with no specified <code>alt</code> attributes, or whose <code>alt</code>
    attributes are the empty string or some other non-visible text, in a user-agent-defined fashion
    intended to indicate the lack of suitable author-provided text.

  </ol>

  If the user agent intends to show the image and allow interaction with the image to select
  hyperlinks, then the image must be associated with a set of layered shapes, taken from the
  <{area}> elements in <var>areas</var>, in reverse <a>tree order</a> (so the last
  specified <{area}> element in the <var>map</var> is the bottom-most shape, and
  the first element in the <var>map</var>, in <a>tree order</a>, is the top-most shape).

  Each <{area}> element in <var>areas</var> must be processed as follows to
  obtain a shape to layer onto the image:

  <ol>

    <li>Find the state that the element's <code>shape</code> attribute
    represents.</li>

    <li>Use the <a>rules for parsing a list of floating-point numbers</a> to parse the element's
    <code>coords</code> attribute, if it is present, and let the result be the <var>coords</var>
    list. If the attribute is absent, let the <var>coords</var> list be the empty list.</li>

    <li>

    If the number of items in the <var>coords</var> list is less than the minimum number
    given for the <{area}> element's current state, as per the following table, then the
    shape is empty; abort these steps.

    <table>
      <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>State
        </th><th>Minimum number of items
      </th></tr></thead><tbody>

        <td><a state for="area">Rectangle state</a>
        </td><td>4
    </td></tr></tbody></table>

    </li>

    <li>

    Check for excess items in the <var>coords</var> list as per the entry in the
    following list corresponding to the <code>shape</code> attribute's
    state:

    <dl class="switch">
      <dt><a state for="area">Circle state</a></dt>
      <dd>Drop any items in the list beyond the third.</dd>
      <dt><a state for="area">Default state</a></dt>
      <dd>Drop all items in the list.</dd>
      <dt><a state for="area">Polygon state</a></dt>
      <dd>Drop the last item if there's an odd number of items.</dd>
      <dt><a state for="area">Rectangle state</a></dt>
      <dd>Drop any items in the list beyond the fourth.</dd>
    </dl>

    </li>

    <li>If the <code>shape</code> attribute represents the <a state for="area">rectangle state</a>, and the first number in the list is
    numerically greater than the third number in the list, then swap those two numbers around.</li>

    <li>If the <code>shape</code> attribute represents the <a state for="area">rectangle state</a>, and the second number in the list is
    numerically greater than the fourth number in the list, then swap those two numbers around.</li>

    <li>If the <code>shape</code> attribute represents the <a state for="area">circle state</a>, and the third number in the list is less than
    or equal to zero, then the shape is empty; abort these steps.</li>

    <li>Now, the shape represented by the element is the one described for the entry in the list
    below corresponding to the state of the <code>shape</code> attribute:

    <dl class="switch">

      <dt><a state for="area">Circle state</a></dt>
      <dd>

      Let <var>x</var> be the first number in <var>coords</var>, <var>y</var> be the second number, and <var>r</var> be the third number.

      The shape is a circle whose center is <var>x</var> CSS pixels from the left edge
      of the image and <var>y</var> CSS pixels from the top edge of the image, and whose

      Let <var>the coordinates</var> be (<var>x<sub><var>i</var></sub></var>, <var>y<sub><var>i</var></sub></var>),
      interpreted in CSS pixels measured from the top left of the image, for all integer values of
      <var>i</var> from 0 to (<var>N</var>/2)-1, where <var>N</var> is the number of items in <var>coords</var>.

      The shape is a polygon whose vertices are given by <var>the coordinates</var>, and
      whose interior is established using the even-odd rule. [[GRAPHICS]]

      Let <var>x<sub>1</sub></var> be the first number in <var>coords</var>, <var>y<sub>1</sub></var> be the second number, <var>x<sub>2</sub></var> be the third number, and <var>y<sub>2</sub></var> be the fourth number.

      The shape is a rectangle whose top-left corner is given by the coordinate (<var>x<sub>1</sub></var>, <var>y<sub>1</sub></var>) and whose
      bottom right corner is given by the coordinate (<var>x<sub>2</sub></var>,
      <var>y<sub>2</sub></var>), those coordinates being interpreted as CSS pixels
      from the top left corner of the image.

      </dd>

    </dl>

    For historical reasons, the coordinates must be interpreted relative to the
    <em>displayed</em> image after any stretching caused by the CSS 'width' and 'height' properties
    (or, for non-CSS browsers, the image element's <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes
    — CSS browsers map those attributes to the aforementioned CSS properties).

    <p class="note">
    Browser zoom features and transforms applied using CSS or SVG do not affect the
    coordinates.

  Pointing device interaction with an image associated with a set of layered shapes per the above
  algorithm must result in the relevant user interaction events being first fired to the top-most
  shape covering the point that the pointing device indicated, if any, or to the image element

  itself, if there is no shape covering that point. User agents should make <{area}> elements
  representing <a>hyperlinks</a> <a>focusable</a>, to ensure that they can be selected and
  activated by all users.


  <p class="note">
    Because a <{map}> element (and its <{area}> elements) can be associated with multiple
    <{img}> and <{object}> elements, it is possible for an <{area}> element to correspond to
    multiple <a>focusable area</a>s of the document.
  </p>

  Image maps are <a>live</a>; if the DOM is mutated, then the user agent must act as if it
  had rerun the algorithms for image maps.

<h4 id="mathml">MathML</h4>

  The MathML <{math}> element falls into the <a>embedded content</a>,
  <a>phrasing content</a>, <a>flow content</a>, and <a>palpable content</a> categories for the
  purposes of the content models in this specification.

  When the <a>MathML <code>annotation-xml</code></a> element contains elements from the
  <a>HTML namespace</a>, such elements must all be <a>flow content</a>.

  When the MathML token elements (<a>MathML <code>mi</code></a>, <a>MathML <code>mo</code></a>, <a>MathML <code>mn</code></a>, <a>MathML <code>ms</code></a>,
  and <a>MathML <code>mtext</code></a>) are descendants of HTML elements, they may contain
  <a>phrasing content</a> elements from the <a>HTML namespace</a>. [[!MATHML]]

  User agents must handle text other than <a>inter-element white space</a> found in MathML
  elements whose content models do not allow straight text by pretending for the purposes of MathML
  content models, layout, and rendering that the text is actually wrapped in an <a>MathML <code>mtext</code></a> element in
  the <a>MathML namespace</a>. (Such text is not, however, conforming.)

  User agents must act as if any MathML element whose contents does not match the element's
  content model was replaced, for the purposes of MathML layout and rendering, by an <a>MathML <code>merror</code></a>
  element containing some appropriate error message.

  To enable authors to use MathML tools that only accept MathML in its XML form, interactive HTML
  user agents are encouraged to provide a way to export any MathML fragment as an XML
  namespace-well-formed XML fragment.

  The semantics of MathML elements are defined by the MathML specification and
  [=other applicable specifications=]. [[!MATHML]]

    Here is an example of the use of MathML in an HTML document.
    Some browsers may not be able to render it correctly.

<h4 id="svg">SVG</h4>

  The SVG <{svg}> element falls into the <a>embedded content</a>,
  <a>phrasing content</a>, <a>flow content</a>, and <a>palpable content</a> categories for the
  purposes of the content models in this specification.

  To enable authors to use SVG tools that only accept SVG in its XML form, interactive HTML user
  agents are encouraged to provide a way to export any SVG fragment as an XML namespace-well-formed
  XML fragment.

  When the SVG <{foreignObject}> element contains elements from the <a>HTML namespace</a>, such
  elements must all be <a>flow content</a>. [[!SVG11]]

  The content model for SVG <a element for="svg"><code>title</code></a> elements inside <a>HTML documents</a> is
  <a>phrasing content</a>. (This further constrains the requirements given in the SVG specification.)

  The semantics of SVG elements are defined by the SVG specification and <a>other applicable

<h4 id="sec-dimension-attributes"><dfn>Dimension attributes</dfn></h4>

  <strong>Author requirements</strong>: The
  <dfn element-attr for="media,img,iframe,embed,object,video,input"><code>width</code></dfn> and
  <dfn element-attr for="media,img,iframe,embed,object,video,input"><code>height</code></dfn>
  attributes on <{img}>, <{iframe}>, <{embed}>, <{object}>, <{video}>, and, when their
  <code>type</code> attribute is in the <{input/Image|Image Button}> state, <{input}> elements
  may be specified to give the dimensions of the visual content of the element (the width and
  height respectively, relative to the nominal direction of the output medium), in CSS pixels.
  The attributes, if specified, must have values that are <a>valid non-negative integers</a>.

  The specified dimensions given may differ from the dimensions specified in the resource itself,
  since the resource may have a resolution that differs from the CSS pixel resolution. (On screens,
  CSS pixels have a resolution of 96ppi, but in general the CSS pixel resolution depends on the
  reading distance.) If both attributes are specified, then one of the following statements must be
  true:

  <ul>

    <li><var>specified width</var> - 0.5 ≤
              <var>specified height</var> * <var>target ratio</var> ≤
              <var>specified width</var> + 0.5</li>

    <li><var>specified height</var> - 0.5 ≤
              <var>specified width</var> / <var>target ratio</var> ≤
              <var>specified height</var> + 0.5</li>

    <li><var>specified height</var> = <var>specified width</var> = 0</li>

  </ul>

  The <var>target ratio</var> is the ratio of the <a for="css">intrinsic width</a> to the
  <a for="css">intrinsic height</a> in the resource. The <var>specified width</var> and
  <var>specified height</var> are the values of the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>
  attributes respectively.

  The two attributes must be omitted if the resource in question does not have both an
  <a for="css">intrinsic width</a> and an <a for="css">intrinsic height</a>.

  If the two attributes are both zero, it indicates that the element is not intended for the user
  (e.g., it might be a part of a service to count page views).

  <p class="note">
    The dimension attributes are not intended to be used to stretch the image.
  </p>

  <strong>User agent requirements</strong>: User agents are expected to use these attributes <a>as hints for the rendering</a>.

  The
  <dfn attribute for="HTMLIFrameElement,HTMLEmbedElement,HTMLObjectElement,HTMLVideoElement"><code>width</code></dfn>
  and
  <dfn attribute for="HTMLIFrameElement,HTMLEmbedElement,HTMLObjectElement,HTMLVideoElement"><code>height</code></dfn>
  IDL attributes on the <{iframe}>, <{embed}>, <{object}>, and <{video}> elements must
  <a>reflect</a> the respective content attributes of the same name.

  <p class="note">
    For <{iframe}>, <{embed}>, and <{object}> the IDL
    attributes are <code>DOMString</code>; for <{video}> the IDL attributes are
    <code>unsigned long</code>.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    The corresponding IDL attributes for <{img}> and
    <{input}> elements are defined in those respective elements'
    sections, as they are slightly more specific to those elements' other behaviors.
