    DOM

  This source produces chapter 3: "Semantics, structure, and APIs of HTML documents"
  https://w3c.github.io/html/dom.html

  It covers:
  - the "Document" object, significantly extending what is defined in the DOM specification
      including attributes of it like document.cookies, document.referrer, document.head, document.forms, etc.
  - The HTMLElement interface
  - The CEReactions extended attribute
  - How elements and attributes are described in the spec
  - Content models - used in element descriptions
  - Global attributes
  - .innerText
  - Some requirements for the Bidi algorithm
  - Some requirements for the role and aria-* attributes

<h2 id="dom">Semantics, structure, and APIs of HTML documents</h2>

<h3 id="documents">Documents</h3>

  Every XML and HTML document in an HTML UA is represented by a {{Document}} object. [[!DOM]]

  The {{Document}} object's [=Document/URL=] is defined in the DOM specification. It is initially
  set when the {{Document}} object is created, but that can change during the lifetime of the
  {{Document}} object; for example, it changes when the user [=navigates=] to a [=url/fragment=] on
  the page and when the {{History/pushState()}} method is called with a new [=url/URL=]. [[!DOM]]

  <p class="warning">Interactive user agents typically expose the {{Document}} object's
  [=Document/URL=] in their user interface. This is the primary mechanism by which a user can tell
  if a site is attempting to impersonate another.</p>

  When a {{Document}} is created by a [=concept/script=] using the
  {{DOMImplementation/createDocument()}} or {{DOMImplementation/createHTMLDocument()}} APIs, the
  {{Document}} is both [=ready for post-load tasks=] and [=completely loaded=] immediately.

  <dfn>The document's referrer</dfn> is a string (representing a [=url/URL=]) that can be set when
  the {{Document}} is created. If it is not explicitly set, then its value is the empty string.

  Each {{Document}} object has a <dfn>reload override flag</dfn> that is originally unset. The flag
  is set by the {{Document/open()|document.open()}} and {{Document/write()|document.write()}}
  methods in certain situations. When the flag is set, the {{Document}} also has a
  <dfn>reload override buffer</dfn> which is a Unicode string that is used as the source of the
  document when it is reloaded.

  When the user agent is to perform
  <dfn lt="overridden reload|an overridden reload">an overridden reload</dfn>, given a
  [=source browsing context=], it must act as follows:

  1. Let |source| be the value of the [=browsing context=]'s [=active document=]'s
      [=reload override buffer=].
  2. Let |address| be the [=browsing context=]'s [=active document=]'s [=document url|URL=].
  3. Let |HTTPS state| be the <a for="document">HTTPS state</a> of the [=browsing context=]'s
      [=active document=].
  4. Let |referrer policy| be the <a lt="document referrer policy">referrer policy</a> of the
      [=browsing context=]'s [=active document=].
  4. Let |CSP list| be the <a for="document">CSP list</a> of the [=browsing context=]'s
      [=active document=].
  5. [=Navigate=] the [=browsing context=] to a new [=response=] whose [=response/body=] is
      |source|, [=response/header list=] is <code>Referrer-Policy/</code>|referrer policy|,
      [=response/CSP list=] is |CSP list| and [=response/HTTPS state=] is |HTTPS state|, with the
      [=exceptions enabled flag=] set and [=replacement enabled=]. The [=source browsing context=]
      is that given to the [=overridden reload=] algorithm. When the [=navigate=] algorithm creates
      a {{Document}} object for this purpose, set that {{Document}}'s [=reload override flag=] and
      set its [=reload override buffer=] to |source|. Rethrow any exceptions.

      When it comes time to <a>set the document's address</a> in the [=navigation algorithm=], use
      |address| as the [=override URL=].

<h4 id="the-document-object">The <dfn element>Document</dfn> object</h4>

  The DOM specification defines a {{Document}} interface, which this specification extends
  significantly:

  The {{Document}} has an <dfn for="document">HTTPS state</dfn> (an [=HTTPS state value=]),

  The {{Document}} has a

  (a [=referrer policy=]), initially the empty string, which represents the default
  [=referrer policy=] used by [=fetches=] initiated by the {{Document}}.

  The {{Document}} has a <dfn for="document">CSP list</dfn>, which is a <a for="/">CSP list</a>
  containing all of the [=Content Security Policy=] objects active for the document. The
  list is empty unless otherwise specified.</p>

  The {{Document}} has a <dfn lt="document module map">module map</dfn>, which is a [=module map=],
  initially empty.

  The <dfn attribute for="Document"><code>cookie</code></dfn> attribute represents the cookies of

  * A {{Document}} that has no [=browsing context=].
  * A {{Document}} whose [=Document/URL=]'s [=url/scheme=] is not a [=network scheme=].

  On getting, if the document is a [=cookie-averse=] {{Document}} object, then the user agent must
  return the empty string. Otherwise, if the {{Document}}'s [=concept/origin=] is an
  [=opaque origin=], the user agent must throw a "{{SecurityError}}" {{DOMException}}. Otherwise,

  <p class="note">Since the {{Document/cookie}} attribute is accessible across frames, the path

  <p class="warning">The {{Document/cookie}} attribute's getter and setter synchronously access
  shared state. Since there is no locking mechanism, other browsing contexts in a multiprocess user
  agent can modify cookies while scripts are running. A site could, for instance, try to read a
  cookie, increment its value, then write it back out, using the new value of the cookie as a unique
  identifier for the session; if the site does this twice in two different browser windows at the

  The {{Document}}'s source file's last modification date and time must be derived from relevant

<h3 id="elements">Elements</h3>

<h4 id="elements-semantics">Semantics</h4>

  Elements, attributes, and attribute values in HTML are defined (by this specification) to have
  certain meanings (semantics). For example, the <{ol}> element represents an ordered list,
  and the <{global/lang}> attribute represents the language of the content.

  These definitions allow HTML processors, like web browsers and search engines, to present
  documents and applications consistently in different contexts.

  <div class="example">
    In this example the HTML headings may be presented as large text in a desktop browser, or
    standard size text in bold in a mobile browser. In both cases the semantic information remains
    the same - that the <{h1}> and <{h2}> elements represent headings.

  This semantic information is critical to assistive technologies. For example, a screen reader will
  query the browser for semantic information and use that information to present the document or
  application in synthetic speech.

  In some cases assistive technologies use semantic information to provide additional functionality.
  A speech recognition tool might provide a voice command for moving focus to the start of the
  <{main}> element for example.

  When the appropriate HTML element or attribute is not used, it deprives HTML processors of
  valuable semantic information.

  <div class="example">
    In this example styling may be used to create a visual representation of headings and other
    components, but because the appropriate HTML elements have not been used there is little
    semantic information available to web browsers, search engines and assistive technologies.

  A document can change dynamically while it is being processed. Scripting and other mechanisms can
  be used to change attribute values, text, or the entire document structure. The semantics of a
  document are therefore based on the document's state at a particular instance in time, but may
  also change in response to external events. User agents must update their presentation of the
  document to reflect these changes.

  <p id="no-browsing-context">DOM nodes whose [=node document=] does not have a [=browsing context=] are exempt from all document conformance requirements other than [=the HTML syntax=] requirements and [=the XML syntax=] requirements.</p>

  <div class="example">
    In this example the <{audio}> element is used to play a music track. The <{audio/controls}>
    attribute is used to show the user agent player, and as the music plays the controls are updated
    to indicate progress. The available semantic information is updated in response to these
    changes.

<h4 id="elements-in-the-dom">Elements in the DOM</h4>

  The nodes representing [=HTML elements=] in the DOM must implement, and expose to scripts, the
  interfaces listed for them in the relevant sections of this specification. This includes
  [=HTML elements=] in [=XML documents=], even when those documents are in another context (e.g.,
  inside an XSLT transform).

  Elements in the DOM <dfn>represent</dfn> things; that is, they have intrinsic <em>meaning</em>,
  also known as semantics.

  <p class="example">For example, an <{ol}> element represents an ordered list.</p>

  The basic interface, from which all the [=HTML elements=]' interfaces inherit, and which must be
  used by elements that have no additional requirements, is the {{HTMLElement}} interface.

  <pre class="idl" data-highlight="webidl">
    [HTMLConstructor]
    interface HTMLElement : Element {
      // metadata attributes
      [CEReactions] attribute DOMString title;
      [CEReactions] attribute DOMString lang;
      [CEReactions] attribute boolean translate;
      [CEReactions] attribute DOMString dir;

      // user interaction
      [CEReactions] attribute boolean hidden;
      void click();
      [CEReactions] attribute DOMString accessKey;
      [CEReactions] attribute boolean draggable;
      [CEReactions] attribute boolean spellcheck;
      void forceSpellCheck();
      [CEReactions, TreatNullAs=EmptyString] attribute DOMString innerText;
    };
    HTMLElement implements GlobalEventHandlers;
    HTMLElement implements DocumentAndElementEventHandlers;
    HTMLElement implements ElementContentEditable;

    // Note: intentionally not [HTMLConstructor]
    interface HTMLUnknownElement : HTMLElement { };
  </pre>

  The {{HTMLElement}} interface holds methods and attributes related to a number of disparate
  features, and the members of this interface are therefore described in various different sections
  of this specification.

  The {{HTMLUnknownElement}} interface must be used for [=HTML elements=] that are not defined by
  this specification (or [=other applicable specifications=]).

  The [=element interface=] for an element with name |name| in the [=HTML namespace=] is determined
  as follows:

  1. If |name| is <{applet}>, <{bgsound}>, <{blink}>, <{isindex}>, <{multicol}>, <{nextid}>, or <{spacer}>, then
      return {{HTMLUnknownElement}}.
  2. If |name| is <{acronym}>, <{basefont}>, <{big}>, <{center}>, <{nobr}>, <{noembed}>,
      <{noframes}>, <{plaintext}>, <{rb}>, <{rtc}>, <{strike}>, or <{tt}>, then return
      {{HTMLElement}}.
  3. If |name| is <{listing}> or <{xmp}>, then return {{HTMLPreElement}}.
  4. Otherwise, if this specification defines an interface appropriate for the [=element type=]
      corresponding to the local name |name|, then return that interface.
  5. If [=other applicable specifications=] define an appropriate interface for |name|, then
      return the interface they define.
  6. If |name| is a [=valid custom element name=], then return {{HTMLElement}}.
  7. Return {{HTMLUnknownElement}}.

  <p class="note">The use of {{HTMLElement}} instead of {{HTMLUnknownElement}} in the case of
  [=valid custom element names=] is done to ensure that any potential future [=upgrades=] only cause
  a linear transition of the element's prototype chain, from {{HTMLElement}} to a subclass, instead
  of a lateral one, from {{HTMLUnknownElement}} to an unrelated subclass.</p>

  Features shared between HTML and SVG elements are defined in the {{HTMLOrSVGElement}} interface mixin:

  <pre class="idl" data-highlight="webidl">
    interface mixin HTMLOrSVGElement {
      [SameObject] readonly attribute DOMStringMap dataset;
      attribute DOMString nonce;

      [CEReactions] attribute long tabIndex;
      void focus(optional FocusOptions options);
      void blur();
    };

    HTMLElement includes HTMLOrSVGElement;
    SVGElement includes HTMLOrSVGElement;
  </pre>

   <h4 id="custom-elements-api">The CustomElementRegistry interface</h4>

   <p>Each {{Window}} object is associated with a unique instance of a {{CustomElementRegistry}}
    object, allocated when the {{Window}} object is created.</p>

   <p class="note">Custom element registries are associated with {{Window}} objects, instead of {{Document}} objects, since each <a>custom element constructor</a> inherits from the
    {{HTMLElement}} interface, and there is exactly one {{HTMLElement}} interface per {{Window}} object.</p>

   The {{Window/customElements}} attribute of the {{Window}} interface returns the {{CustomElementRegistry}}
   object for that {{Window}} object.

   <pre class="idl">
interface CustomElementRegistry {
[CEReactions] void define(DOMString name, Function constructor, optional ElementDefinitionOptions options);
any get(DOMString name);
Promise&lt;void&gt; whenDefined(DOMString name);
};

dictionary ElementDefinitionOptions {
DOMString extends;
};
</pre>

  Every {{CustomElementRegistry}} has:

  <ul>
  <li>a set of <a>custom element definitions</a>, initially empty.
  In general, algorithms in this specification look up elements in the registry by any of
  <a for="customElements">name</a>, <a>local name</a>, or {{constructor}}.
  </li>

  <li>an <dfn export>element definition is running</dfn>
  flag, used to prevent reentrant invocations of <a>element definition</a>. It is initially unset.
  </li>

  <li>a <dfn export>when-defined promise map</dfn>, mapping <a>valid custom element names</a>
   to promises. It is used to implement the {{whenDefined()}} method.</p>
   </li>
   </ul>


   <dl class="domintro note">
     <dt><var>window</var> . {{customElements}} . {{define()|define(<var>name</var>}}, <var>constructor</var>)</dt>

     </dd>

     <dd>
       Returns a promise that will be fulfilled when a <a>custom element</a>
       becomes defined with the name |name|.
       (If such a <a>custom element</a> is already defined, the returned promise will be immediately fulfilled.)
       Returns a promise rejected with a "{{SyntaxError}}" {{DOMException}} if |name| is not a

   <dfn export>Element definition</dfn> is the process of adding a
   <a>custom element definition</a> to the {{CustomElementRegistry}}.
   This is accomplished by the {{define()}} method. When invoked, the

   </ol>

  <h4 id="sec-custom-element-reactions">Custom element reactions</h4>

  A <a>custom element</a> can react to certain occurrences by running author code.
  These reactions are called <dfn export>custom element reactions</dfn>.

  <ul>
    <li>
      When <a lt="upgrade">upgraded</a>, its <a for="customElements">constructor</a> is run.
    </li>

    <li>
      When it <a>becomes connected</a>, its <code>connectedCallback</code> is run.
    </li>

    <li>
      When it <a>becomes disconnected</a>, its <code>disconnectedCallback</code> is run.
    </li>

    <li>
      When it is <a>adopted</a> into a new document, its <code>adoptedCallback</code> is run.
    </li>

    <li>
      When any of its attributes are <a>changed</a>, <a>appended</a>, <a>removed</a>,
      or <a>replaced</a>, its <code>attributeChangedCallback</code> is run.
    </li>
  </ul>


  The way in which <a>custom element reactions</a> are invoked is done with special care, to avoid
  running author code during the middle of delicate operations. Effectively, they are delayed
  until "just before returning to user script". This means that for most purposes they appear to
  execute synchronously, but in the case of complicated composite operations (like <a>cloning</a>,
  or <a>range</a> manipulation), they will instead be delayed until after all the relevant user
  agent processing steps have completed, and then run together as a batch.

  Additionally, the precise ordering of these reactions is managed by a stack-of-queues system,
  described below. The intention behind this system is to guarantee that
  <a>custom element reactions</a> are always invoked in the same order as their triggering actions,
  at least within the local context of a single <a>custom element</a>.
  (Because <a>custom element reaction</a> code can perform its own mutations,
  it is not possible to give a global ordering guarantee across multiple elements.)

  <hr>

  Each <a>unit of related similar-origin browsing contexts</a> has a
  <dfn export>custom element reactions stack</dfn>, which is initially empty.
  The <dfn export>current element queue</dfn> is the <a>element queue</a>
  at the top of the <a>custom element reactions stack</a>. Each item in the stack is an
  <dfn export>element queue</dfn>, which is initially empty as well.
  Each item in an <a>element queue</a> is an element. (The elements are not necessarily
  <a>custom</a> yet, since this queue is used for <a>upgrades</a> as well.)

  Each <a>custom element reactions stack</a> has an associated
  <dfn export>backup element queue</dfn>, which is an initially empty <a>element queue</a>.
  Elements are pushed onto the <a>backup element queue</a> during operations that affect the DOM
  without going through an API decorated with [{{CEReactions}}], or through the parser's
  <a>create an element for the token</a> algorithm.
  An example of this is a user-initiated editing operation which modifies the descendants or
  attributes of an <a>editable</a> element. To prevent reentrancy when processing the
  <a>backup element queue</a>, each <a>custom element reactions stack</a> also has a
  <dfn export>processing the backup element queue</dfn> flag, initially unset.

  All elements have an associated <dfn export>custom element reaction queue</dfn>, initially empty.
  Each item in the <a>custom element reaction queue</a> is of one of two types:

  <ul>
    <li>
      An <dfn export>upgrade reaction</dfn>, which <a>upgrades</a> the custom element
      and contains a <a>custom element definition</a>; or
    </li>

    <li>
      A <dfn export>callback reaction</dfn>, which will call a <a>lifecycle callback</a>,
      and contains a {{Function!!callback}} as well as a list of arguments.
    </li>
  </ul>

  This is all summarised in the following schematic diagram:

  <img src="custom-element-reactions.svg" alt="A custom element reactions stack consists of a stack of element queues. Zooming in on a particular queue, we see that it contains a number of elements (in our example, &lt;x-a&gt;, then &lt;x-b&gt;, then &lt;x-c&gt;). Any particular element in the queue then has a custom element reaction queue. Zooming in on the custom element reaction queue, we see that it contains a variety of queued-up reactions (in our example, upgrade, then attribute changed, then another attribute changed, then connected)." style="width: 80%; max-width: 580px;">

   The <dfn export dfn-type="extended-attribute" lt="CEReactions"><code>[CEReactions]</code></dfn>
   IDL <a>extended attribute</a> is to ensure <a>custom element reactions</a> are triggered appropriately.
   It indicates that the relevant algorithm is to be supplemented with additional steps
   to appropriately track and invoke <a>custom element reactions</a>.

   The [{{CEReactions}}] extended attribute must take no arguments,
   and must not appear on anything other than an operation, attribute, setter, or deleter.
   Additionally, it must not appear on {{readonly}} attributes,
   unless the readonly attribute is also annotated with [PutForwards].

   Operations, attributes, setters, or deleters annotated with the [{{CEReactions}}]
   extended attribute must run the following steps
   surrounding the main algorithm specified for the operation, setter, deleter, or for the attribute's setter:

   <dl>
     <dt>Before executing the algorithm's steps</dt>

     <dd>
       Push a new <a>element queue</a> onto the <a>custom element reactions stack</a>.
     </dd>

     <dt>After executing the algorithm's steps</dt>

     <dd>
       Pop the <a>element queue</a> from the <a>custom element reactions stack</a>, and
       <a>invoke custom element reactions</a> in that queue.
     </dd>
   </dl>

   <div class="note">
     The intent behind this extended attribute is somewhat subtle.
     One way of accomplishing its goals would be to say that every operation, attribute, setter,
     and deleter on the platform should have these steps inserted,
     and to allow implementers to optimize away unnecessary cases
     (where no DOM mutation is possible that could cause <a>custom element reactions</a> to occur).

     However, this could lead to non-interoperable implementations if implementations do not
     invoke these steps in some cases. Explicitly annotating all relevant IDL constructs helps
     ensure interoperable behavior, by identifying all cases where these steps are necessary.
   </div>

   Any nonstandard APIs introduced by the user agent that could modify the DOM in such a way as to
   <a>enqueue a custom element callback reaction</a> or
   <a>enqueue a custom element upgrade reaction</a>, for example by modifying any attributes or
   child elements, must also be decorated with the [{{CEReactions}}] attribute.</p>

   <div class="note">

  <h4 id="html-element-constructors">HTML: HTML element constructors</h4>

  To support <a>custom elements</a>, all HTML elements have special constructor behavior.
  The <dfn export dfn-type="extended-attribute" lt="HTMLConstructor"><code>[HTMLConstructor]</code></dfn>
  IDL <a>extended attribute</a> indicates that the interface object for the given interface
  will have a specific behavior, as defined in detail below.</p>

  The [{{HTMLConstructor}}] extended attribute must take no arguments, and must not appear on
  anything other than an interface. It must appear only once on an interface, and the interface
  must not be annotated with the [{{Constructor!!extended-attribute}}] or [{{NoInterfaceObject}}]
  extended attributes. (However, the interface may be annotated with [{{NamedConstructor}}];
  there is no conflict there.) It must not be used on a callback interface.</p>

  <a>Interface objects</a> for interfaces annotated with the [{{HTMLConstructor}}] extended
  attribute must run the following steps as the function body behavior for both \[[Call]]
  and \[[Construct]] invocations of the corresponding JavaScript function object.

  When invoked with \[[Call]], <code>newTarget</code> is undefined, and the algorithm will throw.
  When invoked with \[[Construct]], the \[[Construct]] <code>newTarget</code> parameter provides
  the <var>NewTarget</var> value.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Let <var>registry</var> be the <a>current global object</a>'s
      {{CustomElementRegistry}} object.

<h4 id="element-definitions">Element definitions</h4>

  Each element in this specification has a definition that includes the following information:

  : <dfn>Categories</dfn>
  :: A list of [=categories=] to which the element belongs. These are used when defining the
      [=content models=] for each element.

  : <dfn>Contexts in which this element can be used</dfn>
  :: A <em>non-normative</em> description of where the element can be used. This information is
      redundant with the content models of elements that allow this one as a child, and is provided
      only as a convenience.

      <p class="note">
        For simplicity, only the most specific expectations are listed. For example,
        an element that is both [=flow content=] and [=phrasing content=] can be used anywhere
        that either [=flow content=] or [=phrasing content=] is expected, but since anywhere that
        [=flow content=] is expected, [=phrasing content=] is also expected (since all
        [=phrasing content=] is [=flow content=]), only "where [=phrasing content=] is expected"
        will be listed.

  : <dfn>Content model</dfn>
  :: A normative description of what content must be included as children and descendants of the
      element.

  : <dfn>Tag omission in text/html</dfn>
  :: A <em>non-normative</em> description of whether, in the <code>[[#text-html|text/html]]</code>
      syntax, the [=start tag|start=] and [=end tag|end=] tags can be omitted. This information is
      redundant with the normative requirements given in the [=omitted|optional tags=] section, and
      is provided in the element definitions only as a convenience.

  : <dfn>Content attributes</dfn>
  :: A normative list of attributes that may be specified on the element (except where otherwise
      disallowed), along with non-normative descriptions of those attributes. (The content to the
      left of the dash is normative, the content to the right of the dash is not.)

  : <dfn>Allowed ARIA role attribute values</dfn>
  :: A non normative list of [[#aria-role-attribute|ARIA role attribute]] values that may be
      specified on the element (except where otherwise disallowed). Each value is linked to a non
      normative description.

  : <dfn>Allowed ARIA state and property attributes</dfn>
  :: Links to the [=Global aria-* attributes=] list and the
      [[#allowed-aria-roles-states-and-properties|allowed roles, states and properties]] table as
      described in the [[#state-and-property-attributes|state and property attributes]] section.

  : <dfn>DOM interface</dfn>
  :: A normative definition of a DOM interface that such elements must implement.

  This is then followed by a description of what the element [=represents=], along with any
  additional normative conformance criteria that may apply to authors
  and implementations. Examples are sometimes also included.

<h5 id="element-definitions-attributes">Attributes</h5>

  An attribute value is a string. Except where otherwise specified, attribute values on
  [=HTML elements=] may be any string value, including the empty string, and there is no
  restriction on what text can be specified in such attribute values.

<h4 id="content-models">Content models</h4>

  Each element defined in this specification has a content model: a description of the element's
  expected <a lt="element content">contents</a>. An [=HTML element=] must have contents that match
  the requirements described in the element's content model.
  The <dfn lt="element contents">contents of an element</dfn> are its children in the DOM.

  <p class="note">
    When a <{template}> element is being parsed, its children are assigned to the
    [=template contents=] (a separate {{DocumentFragment}} assigned to the element when the
    element is created), rather than its children.
  </p>

  The [=space characters=] are always allowed between elements. User agents represent these
  characters between elements in the source markup as {{Text}} nodes in the DOM. Empty {{Text}}
  nodes and {{Text}} nodes consisting of just sequences of those characters are considered
  <dfn>inter-element white space</dfn>.

  [=Inter-element white space=], comment nodes, and processing instruction nodes must be ignored
  when establishing whether an element's contents match the element's content model or not, and
  must be ignored when following algorithms that define document and element semantics.

  <p class="note">
    Thus, an element |A| is said to be <i>preceded or followed</i> by a second element
    |B| if |A| and |B| have the same parent node and there are no other element nodes or {{Text}}
    nodes (other than [=inter-element white space=]) between them. Similarly, a node is the
    <i>only child</i> of an element if that element contains no other nodes other than
    [=inter-element white space=], comment nodes, and processing instruction nodes.
  </p>

  Authors must not use [=HTML elements=] anywhere except where they are explicitly allowed, as
  defined for each element, or as explicitly required by other specifications. For XML compound
  documents, these contexts could be inside elements from other namespaces, if those elements are
  defined as providing the relevant contexts.

  <div class="example">
    For example, the Atom specification defines a <a element for="atom"><code>content</code></a>
    element. When its <{atom/type}> attribute has the value <code>xhtml</code>, the Atom
    specification requires that it contain a single HTML <{div}> element. Thus, a <{div}> element
    is allowed in that context, even though this is not explicitly normatively stated by this
    specification. [[RFC4287]]
  </div>

  In addition, [=HTML elements=] may be orphan nodes (i.e., without a parent node).

  <div class="example">
    For example, creating a <{td}> element and storing it in a global variable in a script is
    conforming, even though <{td}> elements are otherwise only supposed to be used inside <{tr}>
    elements.

    <pre highlight="javascript">
      var data = {
        name: "Banana",
        cell: document.createElement('td'),
      };
    </pre>
  </div>

<h5 id="the-nothing-content-model">The "nothing" content model</h5>

  When an element's content model is <dfn>nothing</dfn>, the element must contain no {{Text}} nodes
  (other than [=inter-element white space=]) and no element nodes.

  <p class="note">
    Most HTML elements whose content model is "nothing" are also, for convenience,
    [=void elements=] (elements that have no [=end tag=] in the [[#syntax|HTML syntax]]). However,
    these are entirely separate concepts.
  </p>

<h5 id="kinds-of-content">Kinds of content</h5>

  Each element in HTML falls into zero or more
  <dfn lt="content categories|content category">categories</dfn> that group elements with similar
  characteristics together. The following broad categories are used in this specification:

  <ul class="brief">
    * [[#metadata-content|Metadata content]]
    * [[#flow-content|Flow content]]
    * [[#sectioning-content|Sectioning content]]
    * [[#heading-content|Heading content]]
    * [[#phrasing-content|Phrasing content]]
    * [[#embedded-content|Embedded content]]
    * [[#interactive-content|Interactive content]]
  </ul>

  <p class="note">
    Some elements also fall into other categories, which are defined in other parts of
    this specification.
  </p>

  These categories are related as follows:

  <p><object width="1000" height="288" data="images/content-venn.svg"><img src="images/content-venn.png" alt="" width="512" height="288" /></object></p>

  Sectioning content, heading content, phrasing content, embedded content, and interactive content
  are all types of flow content. Metadata is sometimes flow content. Metadata and interactive
  content are sometimes phrasing content. Embedded content is also a type of phrasing content, and
  sometimes is interactive content.

  Other categories are also used for specific purposes. For instance, form controls are specified
  using a number of categories to define common requirements. Some elements have unique
  requirements and do not fit into any particular category.

<h6 id="metadata-content">Metadata content</h6>

  <dfn id="metadata-content-2">Metadata content</dfn> is content that sets up the presentation or
  behavior of the rest of the content, or that sets up the relationship of the document with other
  documents, or that conveys other "out of band" information.

  <ul class="brief category-list">
    <li><{base}>
    <li><{link}>
    <li><{meta}>
    <li><{noscript}>
    <li><{script}>
    <li><{style}>
    <li><{template}>
    <li><{title}>
  </ul>

  Elements from other namespaces whose semantics are primarily metadata-related (e.g., RDF) are
  also [=metadata content=].

  <div class="example">
    Thus, in the XML serialization, one can use RDF, like this:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:r="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
        <head>
          <title>Hedral's Home Page</title>
          <r:RDF>
            <Person xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#" r:about="https://hedral.example.com/#">
              <fullName>Cat Hedral</fullName>
              <mailbox r:resource="mailto:hedral@example.com" />
              <personalTitle>Sir</personalTitle>
            </Person>
          </r:RDF>
        </head>
        <body>
          <h1>My home page</h1>
          <p>I like playing with string, I guess. Sister says squirrels are fun too so sometimes I follow her to play with them.</p>
        </body>
      </html>
    </xmp>

    This isn't possible in the HTML serialization, however.

  <dfn id="sectioning-content-2" lt="sectioning content|sectioning">Sectioning content</dfn> is

  <ul class="brief category-list">

  <p class="note">
    There are also certain elements that are [=sectioning roots=]. These are distinct
    from [=sectioning content=], but they can also have an [=outline=].
  </p>

<h6 id="heading-content">Heading content</h6>

  <dfn id="heading-content-2" lt="heading content|headings">Heading content</dfn> defines the

  </ul>

  <p class="note">
    Most elements that are categorized as phrasing content can only contain elements
    that are themselves categorized as phrasing content, not any flow content.
  </p>

  <dfn id="text-content" lt="text|text content">Text</dfn>, in the context of content models, means
  either nothing, or {{Text}} nodes. [=Text=] is sometimes used as a content model on its own, but
  is also [=phrasing content=], and can be [=inter-element white space=] (if the {{Text}} nodes are
  empty or contain just [=space characters=]).

  {{Text}} nodes and attribute values must consist of [=Unicode characters=], must not contain
  U+0000 characters, must not contain permanently undefined Unicode characters (noncharacters), and
  must not contain [=control characters=] other than [=space characters=]. This specification
  includes extra constraints on the exact value of {{Text}} nodes and attribute values depending on
  their precise context.

  For elements in HTML, the constraints of the [=Text=] [=content model=] also depends on the
  [=kind of element=]. For instance, an "<code>&lt;</code>" inside a <{textarea}> element does not
  need to be escaped in HTML because <{textarea}> is an [=escapable raw text=] element. (This does
  not apply to XHTML. In XHTML, the [=kind of element=] doesn't affect the constraints of the
  [=Text=] [=content model=].)

<h6 id="embedded-content">Embedded content</h6>

  <dfn id="embedded-content-2" lt="embedded content|embedded">Embedded content</dfn> is content
  that imports another resource into the document, or content from another vocabulary that is
  [=document/inserted into the document=].

  <ul class="brief category-list">
    <li><{audio}>
    <li><{canvas}>
    <li><{embed}>
    <li><{iframe}>
    <li><{img}>
    <li>MathML <{math}>
    <li><{object}>
    <li><{picture}>
    <li>SVG <{svg}>
    <li><{video}>
  </ul>

  Elements that are from namespaces other than the [=HTML namespace=] and that convey content but
  not metadata, are [=embedded content=] for the purposes of the content models defined in this
  specification. (For example, MathML, or SVG.)

  Some embedded content elements can have <dfn>fallback content</dfn>: content that is to be used
  when the external resource cannot be used (e.g., because it is of an unsupported format). The
  element definitions state what the fallback is, if any.

<h6 id="interactive-content">Interactive content</h6>

  <dfn id="interactive-content-2" lt="interactive content|interactive">Interactive content</dfn> is
  content that is specifically intended for user interaction.

  <ul class="brief category-list">
    <li><{a}> (if the <{a/href}> attribute is present)
    <li><{audio}> (if the <{audio/controls}> attribute is present)
    <li><{button}>
    <li><{details}>
    <li><{embed}>
    <li><{iframe}>
    <li><{img}> (if the <{img/usemap}> attribute is present)
    <li><{input}> (if the <{input/type}> attribute is <em>not</em> in the <{input/Hidden}> state)
    <li><{label}>
    <li><{select}>
    <li><{textarea}>
    <li><{video}> (if the <{video/controls}> attribute is present)
  </ul>

  The <{global/tabindex}> attribute can also make any element into [=interactive content=].

<h6 id="palpable-content">Palpable content</h6>

  As a general rule, elements whose content model allows any [=flow content=] or
  [=phrasing content=] should have at least one node in its <a lt="element content">contents</a>
  that is <dfn id="palpable-content-2" lt="palpable content|palpable">palpable content</dfn> and
  that does not have the <{global/hidden}> attribute specified.

  <p class="note">
    [=Palpable content=] makes an element non-empty by providing either some descendant
    non-empty [=text=], or else something users can hear (<{audio}> elements) or view
    (<{video}> or <{img}> or <{canvas}> elements) or otherwise interact with (for example,
    interactive form controls).
  </p>

  This requirement is not a hard requirement, however, as there are many cases where an element can
  be empty legitimately, for example when it is used as a placeholder which will later be filled in
  by a script, or when the element is part of a template and would on most pages be filled in but
  on some pages is not relevant.

  Conformance checkers are encouraged to provide a mechanism for authors to find elements that fail
  to fulfill this requirement, as an authoring aid.

  The following elements are palpable content:

  <ul class="brief category-list">
    <li><{a}>
    <li><{abbr}>
    <li><{address}>

<h6 id="script-supporting-elements">Script-supporting elements</h6>

  <dfn id="script-supporting-elements-2">Script-supporting elements</dfn> are those that do not
  [=represent=] anything themselves (i.e., they are not rendered), but are used to support scripts,
  e.g., to provide functionality for the user.

  The following elements are script-supporting elements:

  <ul class="brief category-list">
    <li><{script}>
    <li><{template}>
  </ul>

<h5 id="transparent-content-models">Transparent content models</h5>

  Some elements are described as <dfn>transparent</dfn>; they have "transparent" in the description
  of their content model. The content model of a [=transparent=] element is derived from the
  content model of its parent element: the elements required in the part of the content model that
  is "transparent" are the same elements as required in the part of the content model of the parent
  of the transparent element in which the transparent element finds itself.

  <div class="example">
    For instance, an <{ins}> element inside a <{ruby}> element cannot contain an <{rt}> element,
    because the part of the <{ruby}> element's content model that allows <{ins}> elements is the
    part that allows [=phrasing content=], and the <{rt}> element is not [=phrasing content=].
  </div>

  <p class="note">
    In some cases, where transparent elements are nested in each other, the process
    has to be applied iteratively.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    Consider the following markup fragment:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <p>
        <object>
          <ins>
            <map>
              <a href="/">Apples</a>
            </map>
          </ins>
        </object>
      </p>
    </xmp>

    To check whether "Apples" is allowed inside the <{a}> element, the content models are examined.
    The <{a}> element's content model is transparent, as is the <{map}> element's, as is the
    <{ins}> element's, as is the part of the <{object}> element's in which the <{ins}> element is
    found. The <{object}> element is found in the <{p}> element, whose content model is
    [=phrasing content=]. Thus, "Apples" is allowed, as text is phrasing content.
  </div>

  When a transparent element has no parent, then the part of its content model that is
  "transparent" must instead be treated as accepting any [=flow content=].

<h5 id="paragraphs">Paragraphs</h5>

  <p class="note">
    The term [=paragraph=] as defined in this section is used for more than just the
    definition of the <{p}> element. The [=paragraph=] concept defined here is used to describe
    how to interpret documents. The <{p}> element is merely one of several ways of marking up a
    [=paragraph=].
  </p>

  A <dfn lt="paragraph|paragraphs|implied paragraph|paragraphing|implied|implied paragraphs">paragraph</dfn>
  is typically a run of [=phrasing content=] that forms a block of text with one or more sentences
  that discuss a particular topic, as in typography, but can also be used for more general thematic
  grouping. For instance, an address is also a paragraph, as is a byline, or a
  stanza in a poem.

  <div class="example">
    In the following example, there are two paragraphs in a section. There is also a heading, which
    contains phrasing content that is not a paragraph. Note how the comments and
    [=inter-element white space=] do not form paragraphs.

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <section>
        <h2>Example of paragraphs</h2>
        This is the <em>first</em> paragraph in this example.
        <p>This is the second.</p>
        <!-- This is not a paragraph. -->
      </section>
    </xmp>
  </div>

  Paragraphs in [=flow content=] are defined relative to what the document looks like without the
  <{a}>, <{ins}>, <{del}>, and <{map}> elements complicating matters, since those elements, with
  their hybrid content models, can straddle paragraph boundaries, as shown in the first two
  examples below.

  <p class="note">
    Generally, having elements straddle paragraph boundaries is best avoided.
    Maintaining such markup can be difficult.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    The following example takes the markup from the earlier example and puts <{ins}> and <{del}>
    elements around some of the markup to show that the text was changed (though in this case, the
    changes admittedly don't make much sense). Notice how this example has exactly the same
    paragraphs as the previous one, despite the <{ins}> and <{del}> elements — the <{ins}>
    element straddles the heading and the first paragraph, and the <{del}> element straddles the
    boundary between the two paragraphs.

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <section>
        <ins><h1>Example of paragraphs</h1>
        This is the <em>first</em> paragraph in</ins> this example<del>.
        <p>This is the second.</p></del>
        <!-- This is not a paragraph. -->
      </section>
    </xmp>
  </div>

  Let |view| be a view of the DOM that replaces all <{a}>, <{ins}>, <{del}>, and <{map}> elements
  in the document with their <a lt="element content">contents</a>. Then, in |view|, for each run
  of sibling [=phrasing content=] nodes uninterrupted by other types of content, in an element
  that accepts content other than [=phrasing content=] as well as [=phrasing content=], let
  |first| be the first node of the run, and let |last| be the last node of the run. For each such
  run that consists of at least one node that is neither [=embedded content=] nor
  [=inter-element white space=], a paragraph exists in the original DOM from immediately before
  |first| to immediately after |last|. (Paragraphs can thus span across <{a}>, <{ins}>, <{del}>,
  and <{map}> elements.)

  Conformance checkers may warn authors of cases where they have paragraphs that overlap each other
  (this can happen with <{object}>, <{video}>, <{audio}>, and <{canvas}> elements, and indirectly
  through elements in other namespaces that allow HTML to be further embedded therein, like SVG
  <{svg}> or MathML <{math}>).

  A [=paragraph=] is also formed explicitly by <{p}> elements.

  <p class="note">The <{p}> element can be used to wrap individual paragraphs when there would
  otherwise not be any content other than phrasing content to separate the paragraphs from each
  other.</p>

  <div class="example">
    In the following example, the link spans half of the first paragraph, all of the heading
    separating the two paragraphs, and half of the second paragraph. It straddles the paragraphs
    and the heading.

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <header>
        Welcome!
        <a href="about.html">
          This is home of...
          <h1>The Falcons!</h1>
          The Lockheed Martin multirole jet fighter aircraft!
        </a>
        This page discusses the F-16 Fighting Falcon's innermost secrets.
      </header>
    </xmp>

    Here is another way of marking this up, this time showing the paragraphs explicitly, and
    splitting the one link element into three:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <header>
        <p>Welcome! <a href="about.html">This is home of...</a></p>
        <h1><a href="about.html">The Falcons!</a></h1>
        <p><a href="about.html">The Lockheed Martin multirole jet
        fighter aircraft!</a> This page discusses the F-16 Fighting
        Falcon's innermost secrets.</p>
      </header>
    </xmp>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    It is possible for paragraphs to overlap when using certain elements that define fallback
    content. For example, in the following section:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <section>
        <h2>My Cats</h2>
        You can play with my cat simulator.
        <object data="cats.sim">
          To see the cat simulator, use one of the following links:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="cats.sim">Download simulator file</a>
            <li><a href="https://sims.example.com/watch?v=LYds5xY4INU">Use online simulator</a>
          </ul>
          Alternatively, upgrade to the Mellblom Browser.
        </object>
        I'm quite proud of it.
      </section>
    </xmp>

    There are five paragraphs:

    <ol class="brief">
        1. The paragraph that says "You can play with my cat simulator. <i>object</i> I'm quite
             proud of it.", where <i>object</i> is the <{object}> element.
        2. The paragraph that says "To see the cat simulator, use one of the following links:".
        3. The paragraph that says "Download simulator file".
        4. The paragraph that says "Use online simulator".
        5. The paragraph that says "Alternatively, upgrade to the Mellblom Browser.".
    </ol>

    The first paragraph is overlapped by the other four. A user agent that supports the "cats.sim"
    resource will only show the first one, but a user agent that shows the fallback will
    confusingly show the first sentence of the first paragraph as if it was in the same paragraph
    as the second one, and will show the last paragraph as if it was at the start of the second
    sentence of the first paragraph.

    To avoid this confusion, explicit <{p}> elements can be used. For example:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <section>
        <h2>My Cats</h2>
        <p>You can play with my cat simulator.</p>
        <object data="cats.sim">
          <p>To see the cat simulator, use one of the following links:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="cats.sim">Download simulator file</a>
            <li><a href="https://sims.example.com/watch?v=LYds5xY4INU">Use online simulator</a>
          </ul>
          <p>Alternatively, upgrade to the Mellblom Browser.</p>
        </object>
        <p>I'm quite proud of it.</p>
      </section>
    </xmp>
  </div>

<h4 id="global-attributes"><dfn id="global-attributes-2" lt="global attributes|globals">Global attributes</dfn></h4>

  The following attributes are common to and may be specified on all [=HTML elements=] (even those
  not defined in this specification):

  <ul class="brief">
    * <{global/accesskey}>
    * Attributes whose name begins with [=global aria-* attributes|aria-*=]
    * <{global/class}>
    * <{global/contenteditable}>
    * <{global/dir}>
    * Attributes whose name begins with [=custom data attribute|data-=]
    * <{global/draggable}>
    * <{global/hidden}>
    * <{global/id}>
    * <{global/is}>
    * <{global/lang}>
    * <{global/nonce}>
    * <{aria/role}>
    * <{global/spellcheck}>
    * <{global/style}>
    * <{global/tabindex}>
    * <{global/title}>
    * <{global/translate}>
    * <{xmlns/xmlns}>
  </ul>

  These attributes are only defined by this specification as attributes for [=HTML elements=]. When
  this specification refers to elements having these attributes, elements from namespaces that are
  not defined as having these attributes must not be considered as being elements with these
  attributes.

  <div class="example">
    For example, in the following XML fragment, the "<code>bogus</code>" element does not have a
    <{global/dir}> attribute as defined in this specification, despite having an attribute with the
    literal name "<{global/dir}>". Thus, [=the directionality=] of the inner-most <{span}> element
    is '<a attr-value for="global/dir"><code>rtl</code></a>', inherited from the <{div}> element
    indirectly through the "<code>bogus</code>" element.

    <xmp highlight="html" class="bad">
      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" dir="rtl">
        <bogus xmlns="https://example.net/ns" dir="ltr">
          <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
          </span>
        </bogus>
      </div>
    </xmp>
  </div>

  <hr>

  When specified on [=HTML elements=], the <dfn element-attr for="global"><code>class</code></dfn>
  attribute's value must be a [=set of space-separated tokens=]
  representing the various classes that the element belongs to.

  The DOM specification defines additional user agent requirements for this attribute. [[DOM]]

  <div class="note">
    Assigning classes to an element affects class matching in selectors in CSS, the
    {{Document/getElementsByClassName()}} method in the DOM, and other such features.

    There are no additional restrictions on the tokens authors can use in the <{global/class}>
    attribute, but authors are encouraged to use values that describe the nature of the content,
    rather than values that describe the desired presentation of the content.
  </div>

  When specified on [=HTML elements=], the <dfn element-attr for="global"><code>id</code></dfn>
  attribute value must be unique amongst all the [=IDs=] in the element's [=tree=]
  and must contain at least one character. The value must not contain any [=space characters=].

  The DOM specification defines additional user agent requirements for this attribute. [[DOM]]

  <div class="note">
    The <{global/id}> attribute specifies its element's [=id|unique identifier (ID)=].

    There are no other restrictions on what form an ID can take; in particular, IDs can consist of
    just digits, start with a digit, start with an underscore, consist of just punctuation, etc.

    An element's [=unique identifier=] can be used for a variety of purposes, most notably as a way
    to link to specific parts of a document using <a for="url">fragment</a>, as a way to target an
    element when scripting, and as a way to style a specific element from CSS.
  </div>

  Identifiers are opaque strings. Particular meanings should not be derived from the value of the
  <{global/id}> attribute.

  When specified on an [=HTML element=] the <dfn element-attr for="global"><code>is</code></dfn>
  attribute identifies the element as a <a>customized built-in element</a>. Its value must be a
  <a>valid custom element name</a>.

  Changing the value of the <{global/is}> attribute after the
  [=create an element|element is created=] does not change an element's behaviour.

  There are no conformance requirements for the
  <dfn element-attr for="global"><code>slot</code></dfn> attribute specific to [=HTML elements=].
  The DOM specification defines requirements for this attribute. [[DOM]]

  <p class="note">
    The <{global/slot}> attribute is used for elements in <a>shadow trees</a>,
    to <a>assign a slot</a> for the element. The slot will be assigned to the <{slot}>
    element whose <{slot/name}> attribute matches the value of the <{global/slot}> attribute.
  </p>

  <hr />

  To enable assistive technology products to expose a more fine-grained interface than is otherwise
  possible with HTML elements and attributes, a set of annotations for assistive technology
  products can be specified (the ARIA <{aria/role}> and [=global aria-* attributes|aria-*=]
  attributes). [[!wai-aria-1.1]]

  <p class="note">
    The attributes marked with an asterisk have a different meaning when specified on
    <{body}> elements as those elements expose [=event handlers=] of the {{Window}} object
    with the same names.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    While these attributes apply to all elements, they are not useful on all elements.
    For example, only [=media elements=] will ever receive a {{media/volumechange}}
    event fired by the user agent.
  </p>

  <hr />

  [=Custom data attributes=] (e.g., <code>data-foldername</code> or <code>data-msgid</code>) can be
  specified on any [=HTML element=], to store custom data specific to the page.

  <hr />

  In [=HTML documents=], elements in the [=HTML namespace=] may have an <{xmlns/xmlns}> attribute
  specified, if, and only if, it has the exact value "<code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>".
  This does not apply to [=XML documents=].

  <p class="note">
    In HTML, the <{xmlns/xmlns}> attribute has absolutely no effect. It is basically a talisman.
    It is allowed merely to make migration to and from XML mildly easier. When parsed by an
    [=HTML parser=], the attribute ends up in no namespace, not the
    "<code>http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/</code>" namespace like namespace declaration attributes
    in XML do.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    In XML, an <{xmlns/xmlns}> attribute is part of the namespace declaration
    mechanism, and an element cannot actually have an <{xmlns/xmlns}> attribute
    in no namespace specified.
  </p>

  <hr />

  The XML specification also allows the use of the <{xml/space|xml:space}> attribute in the
  [=XML namespace=] on any element in an [=XML document=]. This attribute has no effect on
  [=HTML elements=], as the default behavior in HTML is to preserve white space. [[!XML]]

  <p class="note">
    There is no way to serialize the <{xml/space|xml:space}> attribute on
    [=HTML elements=] in the <code>[[#text-html|text/html]]</code> syntax.
  </p>

<h5 id="the-title-attribute">The <{global/title}> attribute</h5>

  The <dfn element-attr for="global,figure,div,img,textarea,meter"><code>title</code></dfn>
  attribute [=represents=] advisory information for the element, such as would be appropriate for a
  tooltip. On a link, this could be the title or a description of the target resource; on an image,
  it could be the image credit or a description of the image; on a paragraph, it could be a
  footnote or commentary on the text; on a citation, it could be further information about the
  source; on [=interactive content=], it could be a label for, or instructions for, use of the
  element; and so forth. The value is text.

  <!-- W3C START - DO NOT OVERWRITE-->

  <div class="warning">
    Relying on the <{global/title}> attribute is currently discouraged as many user agents do not
    expose the attribute in an accessible manner as required by this specification (e.g.,
    requiring a pointing device, such as a mouse, to cause a tooltip to appear excludes
    keyboard-only users and touch-only users, such as anyone with a modern phone or tablet).
  </div>

  <!-- W3C END -->

  If this attribute is omitted from an element, then it implies that the <{global/title}> attribute
  of the nearest ancestor [=HTML element=] with a <{global/title}> attribute set is also relevant
  to this element. Setting the attribute overrides this, explicitly stating that the advisory
  information of any ancestors is not relevant to this element. Setting the attribute to the empty
  string indicates that the element has no advisory information.

  If the <{global/title}> attribute's value contains U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters, the content
  is split into multiple lines. Each U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character represents a line break.

  <div class="example">
    Caution is advised with respect to the use of newlines in <{global/title}> attributes.

    For instance, the following snippet actually defines an abbreviation's expansion
    <em>with a line break in it</em>:

    <xmp class="bad" highlight="html">
      <p>
        My logs show that there was some interest in <abbr title="Hypertext
        Transport Protocol">HTTP</abbr> today.
      </p>
    </xmp>
  </div>

  Some elements, such as <{link}>, <{abbr}>, and <{input}>, define additional semantics for the
  <{global/title}> attribute beyond the semantics described above.

  The <dfn>advisory information</dfn> of an element is the value that the following algorithm
  returns, with the algorithm being aborted once a value is returned. When the algorithm returns
  the empty string, then there is no advisory information.

  1. If the element has a <{global/title}> attribute, then return its value.
  2. Otherwise, if the element has a parent element, then return the parent element's
      [=advisory information=].
  3. Otherwise, return the empty string.

  User agents should inform the user when elements have [=advisory information=], otherwise the
  information would not be discoverable.

  <hr />

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLElement"><code>title</code></dfn> IDL attribute must [=reflect=] the
  <{global/title}> content attribute.

<h5 id="the-lang-and-xmllang-attributes">The <{global/lang}> and <{xml/lang|xml:lang}> attributes</h5>

  The <dfn element-attr for="global"><code>lang</code></dfn> attribute (in no namespace) specifies
  the primary language for the element's contents and for any of the element's attributes that
  contain text. Its value must be a valid BCP 47 language tag, or the empty string. Setting the
  attribute to the empty string indicates that the primary language is unknown. [[!BCP47]]

  The <dfn element-attr for="xml"><code>lang</code></dfn> attribute in the [=XML namespace=] is
  defined in XML. [[!XML]]

  If these attributes are omitted from an element, then the language of this element is the same as
  the language of its parent element, if any.

  The <{global/lang}> attribute in no namespace may be used on any [=HTML element=].

  The <{global/lang}> attribute in the [=XML namespace=] may be used on [=HTML elements=] in
  [=XML documents=], as well as elements in other namespaces if the relevant specifications allow it
  (in particular, MathML and SVG allow <{global/lang}> attributes in the [=XML namespace=] to be
  specified on their elements). If both the <{global/lang}> attribute in no namespace and the
  <{global/lang}> attribute in the [=XML namespace=] are specified on the same element, they must
  have exactly the same value when compared in an [=ASCII case-insensitive=] manner.

  Authors must not use the <{global/lang}> attribute in the [=XML namespace=] on [=HTML elements=]
  in [=HTML documents=]. To ease migration to and from XHTML, authors may specify an attribute in
  no namespace with no prefix and with the literal localname "<{xml/lang|xml:lang}>" on
  [=HTML elements=] in [=HTML documents=], but such attributes must only be specified if a
  <{global/lang}> attribute in no namespace is also specified, and both attributes must have the
  same value when compared in an [=ASCII case-insensitive=] manner.

  <p class="note">The attribute in no namespace with no prefix and with the literal localname
  "<{xml/lang|xml:lang}>" has no effect on language processing.</p>

  <div class="warning" id="lang-warning">
    The language of [=HTML documents=] is indicated using a <{global/lang}> attribute (on the
    <{html}> element itself, to indicate the primary language of the document, and on individual
    elements, to indicate a change in language). It provides an explicit indication to user agents
    about the language of content in order to enable language specific behavior. For example,
    use of an appropriate language dictionary; selection of an appropriate font or glyphs for
    characters shared between different languages; or in the case of screen readers and similar
    assistive technologies with voice output, pronunciation of content using the correct voice / language library.

    Incorrect or absent <{global/lang}> attributes can produce unexpected results in other
    circumstances, as they are also used to determine quotation marks for <{q}> elements, styling
    such as hyphenation, case conversion, line-breaking, and spell-checking in some editors, etc.

    <strong>Setting the <{global/lang}> attribute to a language which does not match the language
    of the document or document parts will result in some users being unable to understand the
    content.</strong>

  <hr />

  To determine the <dfn>language</dfn> of a node, user agents must look at the nearest ancestor
  element (including the element itself if the node is an element) that has a <{global/lang}>
  attribute in the [=XML namespace=] set or is an [=HTML element=] and has a <{global/lang}> in no
  namespace attribute set. That attribute specifies the language of the node (regardless of its
  value).

  If both the <{global/lang}> attribute in no namespace and the <{global/lang}> attribute in the
  [=XML namespace=] are set on an element, user agents must use the <{global/lang}> attribute in
  the [=XML namespace=], and the <{global/lang}> attribute in no namespace must be [=ignored=] for the purposes of determining the element's language.

  If node's [=inclusive ancestors=] do not have either attribute set, but there is a
  [=pragma-set default language=] set, then that is the language of the node. If there is no
  [=pragma-set default language=] set, then language information from a higher-level protocol (such
  as HTTP), if any, must be used as the final fallback language instead. In the absence of any such
  language information, and in cases where the higher-level protocol reports multiple languages,
  the language of the node is unknown, and the corresponding language tag is the empty string.

  <p class="example">
    For example, if a document is delivered over HTTP and the
    <a http-header><code>Content-Language</code></a> HTTP header is specified with a value
    "<code>en</code>", then for any element in the document that does not itself have a
    <{global/lang}> attribute nor any ancestor of that element, the fallback language for
    the element will be English. If the value of the
    <a http-header><code>Content-Language</code></a> header was "<code>de, fr, it</code>" then the
    language of the node is unknown.
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-http-and-lang">This article</a> provides
    some additional guidance on the use of HTTP headers, and <{meta}> elements for providing
    language information.
  </p>

  If the resulting value is not a recognized language tag, then it must be treated as an unknown
  language having the given language tag, distinct from all other languages. For the purposes of
  round-tripping or communicating with other services that expect language tags, user agents should
  pass unknown language tags through unmodified, and tagged as being BCP 47 language tags, so that
  subsequent services do not interpret the data as another type of language description. [[!BCP47]]

  <p class="example">
    Thus, for instance, an element with <code>lang="xyzzy"</code> would be matched by the selector
    <code>:lang(xyzzy)</code> (e.g., in CSS), but it would not be matched by
    <code>:lang(abcde)</code>, even though both are equally invalid. Similarly, if a Web browser
    and screen reader working in unison communicated about the language of the element, the
    browser would tell the screen reader that the language was "xyzzy", even if it knew it was
    invalid, just in case the screen reader actually supported a language with that tag after all.
    Even if the screen  reader supported both BCP 47 and another syntax for encoding language
    names, and in that other syntax the string "xyzzy" was a way to denote the Belarusian
    language, it would be *incorrect* for the screen reader to then start treating text as
    Belarusian, because "xyzzy" is not how Belarusian is described in BCP 47 codes
    (BCP 47 uses the code "be" for Belarusian).
  </p>

  If the resulting value is the empty string, then it must be interpreted as meaning that the
  language of the node is explicitly unknown.

  <hr />

  User agents may use the element's language to determine proper processing or rendering (e.g., in
  the selection of appropriate fonts or pronunciations, for dictionary selection, or for the user
  interfaces of form controls such as date pickers).

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLElement"><code>lang</code></dfn> IDL attribute must [=reflect=] the
  <{global/lang}> content attribute in no namespace.

<h5 id="the-translate-attribute">The <{global/translate}> attribute</h5>

  The <dfn element-attr for="global"><code>translate</code></dfn> attribute is an
  [=enumerated attribute=] that is used to specify whether an element's attribute values and the
  values of its {{Text}} node children are to be translated when the page is localized, or whether
  to leave them unchanged.

  The attribute's keywords are the empty string, <code>yes</code>, and <code>no</code>. The empty
  string and the <code>yes</code> keyword map to the <i>yes</i> state. The <code>no</code> keyword
  maps to the <i>no</i> state. In addition, there is a third state, the <i>inherit</i> state, which
  is the [=missing value default=] (and the [=invalid value default=]).

  Each element (even non-HTML elements) has a <dfn>translation mode</dfn>, which is in either the
  [=translate-enabled=] state or the [=no-translate=] state. If an [=HTML element=]'s
  <{global/translate}> attribute is in the <i>yes</i> state, then the element's
  [=translation mode=] is in the [=translate-enabled=] state; otherwise, if the element's
  <{global/translate}> attribute is in the <i>no</i> state, then the element's
  [=translation mode=] is in the [=no-translate=] state. Otherwise, either the element's
  <{global/translate}> attribute is in the <i>inherit</i> state, or the element is not an
  [=HTML element=] and thus does not have a <{global/translate}> attribute; in either case,
  the element's [=translation mode=] is in the same state as its parent element's, if any,
  or in the [=translate-enabled=] state, if the element is a [=document element=].

  When an element is in the <dfn>translate-enabled</dfn> state, the element's
  [=translatable attributes=] and the values of its {{Text}} node children are to be translated
  when the page is localized.

  When an element is in the <dfn>no-translate</dfn> state, the element's attribute values and the
  values of its {{Text}} node children are to be left as-is when the page is localized, e.g.,
  because the element contains a person's name or a name of a computer program.

  The following attributes are <dfn>translatable attributes</dfn>:

  <ul class="brief">
    * <{th/abbr}> on <{th}> elements
    * <code>alt</code> on <{area/alt|area}>, <{img/alt|img}>, and <{input/alt|input}> elements
    * <{meta/content}> on <{meta}> elements, if the <{meta/name}> attribute specifies a metadata
        name whose value is known to be translatable
    * <{links/download}> on <{a}> and <{area}> elements
    * <code>label</code> on <{optgroup/label|optgroup}>, <{option/label|option}>, and <{track/label|track}> elements
    * <{global/lang}> on [=HTML elements=]; must be "translated" to match the language used in the
        translation
    * <code>placeholder</code> on <{input/placeholder|input}> and <{textarea/placeholder|textarea}>
        elements
    * <{iframe/srcdoc}> on <{iframe}> elements; must be parsed and recursively processed
    * <{global/style}> on [=HTML elements=]; must be parsed and recursively processed
        (e.g., for the values of 'content' properties)
    * <{global/title}> on all [=HTML elements=]
    * <{input/value}> on <{input}> elements with a <{input/type}> attribute in the <{input/Button}>
        state or the <{input/Reset|Reset Button}> state
  </ul>

  Other specifications may define other attributes that are also [=translatable attributes=]. For
  example, ARIA would define the <{aria/aria-label}> attribute as translatable.

  <hr />

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLElement"><code>translate</code></dfn> IDL attribute must, on getting,
  return true if the element's [=translation mode=] is [=translate-enabled=], and false otherwise.
  On setting, it must set the content attribute's value to "<code>yes</code>" if the new value is
  true, and set the content attribute's value to "<code>no</code>" otherwise.

  <div class="example">
    In this example, everything in the document is to be translated when the page is localized,
    except the sample keyboard input and sample program output:

    <xmp highlight="html">

<h5 id="the-dir-attribute">The <{global/dir}> attribute</h5>

  The <dfn element-attr for="global"><code>dir</code></dfn> attribute specifies the element's text
  directionality. The attribute is an [=enumerated attribute=] with the following keywords and
  states:

  : The <dfn attr-value for="global/dir"><code>ltr</code></dfn> keyword, which maps to the
      <dfn state for="dir">ltr</dfn> state
  :: Indicates that the contents of the element are explicitly directionally isolated left-to-right
      text.

  : The <dfn attr-value for="global/dir"><code>rtl</code></dfn> keyword, which maps to the
      <dfn state for="dir">rtl</dfn> state
  :: Indicates that the contents of the element are explicitly directionally isolated right-to-left
      text.

  : The <dfn attr-value for="global/dir"><code>auto</code></dfn> keyword, which maps to the
      <dfn state for="dir">auto</dfn> state
  :: Indicates that the contents of the element are explicitly directionally isolated text, but
      that the direction is to be determined programmatically using the contents of the element
      (as described below).

      <p class="note">
        The heuristic used by this state is very crude (it just looks at the first character with
        a strong directionality, in a manner analogous to the Paragraph Level determination in the
        bidirectional algorithm). Authors are urged to only use this value as a last resort when
        the direction of the text is truly unknown and no better server-side heuristic can be
        applied. [[!BIDI]]
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        For <{textarea}> and <{pre}> elements, the heuristic is applied on a per-paragraph level.

  [=uppercase ASCII letters=].

  <p class="note">
    All attribute names on [=HTML elements=] in [=HTML documents=] get ASCII-lowercased
    automatically, so the restriction on ASCII uppercase letters doesn't affect such documents.
  </p>

  [=Custom data attributes=] are intended to store custom data private to the page or application,
  for which there are no more appropriate attributes or elements.

  These attributes are not intended for use by software that is not known to the administrators of
  the site that uses the attributes. For generic extensions that are to be used by multiple
  independent tools, either this specification should be extended to provide the feature
  explicitly, or a technology like microdata should be used (with a standardized vocabulary).

  <div class="example">
    For instance, a site about music could annotate list items representing tracks in an album with
    custom data attributes containing the length of each track. This information could then be used
    by the site itself to allow the user to sort the list by track length, or to filter the list
    for tracks of certain lengths.

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <ol>
        <li data-length="2m11s">Beyond The Sea</li>
        ...
      </ol>
    </xmp>

    It would be inappropriate, however, for the user to use generic software not associated with
    that music site to search for tracks of a certain length by looking at this data.

    This is because these attributes are intended for use by the site's own scripts, and are not a
    generic extension mechanism for publicly-usable metadata.
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    Similarly, a page author could write markup that provides information for a translation tool
    that they are intending to use:

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;p>
        The third <mark>&lt;span data-mytrans-de="Anspruch">claim&lt;/span></mark> covers the case of <mark>&lt;span translate="no">HTML&lt;/span></mark> markup.
      &lt;/p>
    </pre>

    In this example, the "<code>data-mytrans-de</code>" attribute gives specific text for the
    MyTrans product to use when translating the phrase "claim" to German. However, the standard
    <{global/translate}> attribute is used to indicate that "HTML" is to remain unchanged in all
    languages. When a standard attribute is available, there is no need for a
    [=custom data attribute=] to be used.
  </div>

  Every [=HTML element=] may have any number of [=custom data attributes=] specified, with any
  value.

  Authors should carefully design such extensions so that when the attributes are ignored and any
  associated CSS dropped, the page is still usable.

  User agents must not derive any implementation behavior from these attributes or values.
  Specifications intended for user agents must not define these attributes to have any meaningful
  values.

  JavaScript libraries may use the [=custom data attributes=], as they are considered to be part of
  the page on which they are used. Authors of libraries that are reused by many authors are
  encouraged to include their name in the attribute names, to reduce the risk of clashes. Where it
  makes sense, library authors are also encouraged to make the exact name used in the attribute
  names customizable, so that libraries whose authors unknowingly picked the same name can be used
  on the same page, and so that multiple versions of a particular library can be used on the same
  page even when those versions are not mutually compatible.

  <div class="example">
    For example, a library called "DoQuery" could use attribute names like
    <code>data-doquery-range</code>, and a library called "jJo" could use attributes names like
    <code>data-jjo-range</code>. The jJo library could also provide an API to set which prefix to
    use (e.g. <code>J.setDataPrefix("j2")</code>, making the attributes have names like
    <code>data-j2-range</code>).

    If a Web page wanted an element to represent a space ship, e.g., as part of a game, it would

    </xmp>

    Notice how the hyphenated attribute name becomes dromedary-cased in the API.

    : |element| . {{HTMLElement/innerText}} [ = value ]
    :: Returns the element's text content "as rendered".

        Can be set, to replace the element's children with the given value, but with line breaks
        converted to <{br}> elements.
  </dl>

  On getting, the <dfn attribute for="HTMLElement"><code>innerText</code></dfn> attribute must
  follow these steps:

  1. If this element is not [=being rendered=], or if the user agent is a non-CSS user agent, then
      return the same value as the {{Node/textContent}} IDL attribute on this element.
  2. Compute a list of items each of which is a string or a positive integer (a
      |required line break count|), by applying the following recursive procedure to each child
      node |node| of this element in [=tree order=], and then concatenating the results to a
      single list of items.

      <p class="note">
        Intuitively, a |required line break count| item means that a certain number of
        line breaks appear at that point, but they can be collapsed with the line breaks induced
        by adjacent |required line break count| items, reminiscent to CSS margin-collapsing.
      </p>

      1. Let |items| be the result of recursively applying this procedure to each child of |node|
          in [=tree order=], and then concatenating the results to a single list of items.
      2. If |node|'s [=computed value=] of 'visibility' is not "visible", then let the result of
          these substeps be |items| and abort these substeps.
      3. If |node| has no associated CSS box, then let the result of these substeps be |items| and
          abort these substeps. For the purpose of this step, the following elements must act as
          described if the [=computed value=] of the 'display' property is not "none":

          <ul class="brief">
            * <{select}> elements have an associated non-replaced inline CSS box whose child boxes
                include only those of <{optgroup}> and <{option}> element child nodes;
            * <{optgroup}> elements have an associated non-replaced block-level CSS box whose child
                boxes include only those of <{option}> element child nodes; and
            * <{option}> element have an associated non-replaced block-level CSS box whose child
                boxes are as normal for non-replaced block-level CSS boxes.
          </ul>

          <p class="note">
            Items can be non-empty due to "display: contents".
          </p>
      4. If |node| is a {{Text}} node, then for each CSS text box produced by |node|, in content
          order, compute the text of the box after application of the CSS 'white-space' processing
          rules and 'text-transform' rules, let the result of these substeps be a list of the
          resulting strings, and abort these substeps. The CSS 'white-space' processing rules are
          slightly modified: collapsible spaces at the end of lines are always collapsed, but they
          are only removed if the line is the last line of the block, or it ends with a <{br}>
          element. Soft hyphens should be preserved. [[CSS-TEXT-3]]
      5. If |node| is a <{br}> element, then append a string containing a single U+000A LINE FEED
          (LF) character to |items|.
      6. If |node|'s [=computed value=] of 'display' is ''display/table-cell'', and |node|'s CSS
          box is not the last ''table-cell'' box of its enclosing ''table-row'' box, then append a
          string containing a single U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) character to |items|.
      7. If |node|'s [=computed value=] of 'display' is ''display/table-cell'', and |node|'s CSS
          box is not the last ''table-cell'' box of the nearest ancestor ''display/table'' box,
          then append a string containing a single U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character to |items|.
      8. If |node| is a <{p}> element, then add 2 (a |required line break count|) at the beginning
          and end of |items|.
      9. If |node|'s [=used value=] of 'display' is block-level or ''display/table-caption'', then
          add 1 (a |required line break count|) at the beginning and end of |items|.
          [[CSS-DISPLAY-3]]

          <p class="note">
            Floats and absolutely-positioned elements fall into this category.
          </p>
      10. Let the result of these substeps be |items|.
  3. Delete any string items whose strings are empty.
  4. Delete any runs of consecutive |required line break count| items at the start or end of the
      list.
  5. Replace each remaining run of consecutive |required line break count| items with a string
      consisting of as many U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters as the maximum of the values in the
      |required line break count| items.
  6. Return the concatenation of the string |items|.

  <p class="note">
    Note that descendant nodes of most replaced elements (e.g., <{textarea}>, <{input}>, and
    <{video}> — but not <{button}>) are not rendered by CSS, strictly speaking, and therefore
    have no CSS boxes for the purposes of this algorithm.
  </p>

  On setting, the {{HTMLElement/innerText}} attribute must follow these steps:

  1. Let |document| be this element's [=node document=].
  2. Let |fragment| be a new {{DocumentFragment}} object whose [=node document=] is |document|.
  3. Let |input| be the given value.
  4. Let |pointer| be a pointer into |input|, initially pointing at the start of the string.
  5. Let |text| be the empty string.
  6. While |pointer| is not past the end of |input|:
      1. [=Collect a sequence of characters=] that are not U+000A LINE FEED (LF) or U+000D CARRIAGE
          RETURN (CR) characters. Set |text| to the collected characters.
      2. If |text| is not the empty string, then [=append=] a new {{Text}} node whose
          {{CharacterData/data}} is |text| and [=node document=] is |document| to |fragment|.
      3. While |pointer| is not past the end of |input|, and the character at |position| is either
          a U+000A LINE FEED (LF) or U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) character:
          1. If the character at |position| is a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) character and the next
              character is a U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character, then advance |position| to the next
              character in |input|.
          2. Advance |position| to the next character in |input|.
          3. [=Append=] the result of [=creating an element=] given |document|, <{br}>, and the
              [=HTML namespace=] to |fragment|.
  7. [=Replace all=] with |fragment| within this element.
