<h2 id="syntax"><dfn>The HTML syntax</dfn></h2>

  <p class="note">
  This section only describes the rules for resources labeled with an <a>HTML
  MIME type</a>. Rules for XML resources are discussed in the section below entitled "<a>the XHTML syntax</a>".
  </p>

<h3 id="writing-html-documents">Writing HTML documents</h3>

  <i>This section only applies to documents, authoring tools, and markup generators. In
  particular, it does not apply to conformance checkers; conformance checkers must use the
  requirements given in the next section ("parsing HTML documents").</i>

  Documents must consist of the following parts, in the given
  order:

  <ol>

    <li>Optionally, a single U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK (BOM) character.</li>

    <li>Any number of <a>comments</a> and <a>space characters</a>.</li>

    <li>A <a>DOCTYPE</a>.</li>

    <li>Any number of <a>comments</a> and <a>space characters</a>.</li>

    <li>The <a>document element</a>, in the form of an <{html}> element.</li>

    <li>Any number of <a>comments</a> and <a>space characters</a>.</li>

  </ol>

  The various types of content mentioned above are described in the next few sections.

  In addition, there are some restrictions on how <a>character encoding declarations</a> are to be serialized, as discussed in the
  section on that topic.

  <div class="note">

    Space characters before the <{html}> element, and space characters at the start
    of the <{html}> element and before the <{head}> element, will be dropped when
    the document is parsed; space characters <em>after</em> the <{html}> element will
    be parsed as if they were at the end of the <{body}> element. Thus, space characters
    around the <a>document element</a> do not round-trip.

    It is suggested that newlines be inserted after the DOCTYPE, after any comments that are
    before the <a>document element</a>, after the <{html}> element's start tag (if it is not <a>omitted</a>), and after any comments that are inside the
    <{html}> element but before the <{head}> element.

  </div>

  Many strings in the HTML syntax (e.g., the names of elements and their attributes) are
  case-insensitive, but only for <a>uppercase ASCII letters</a> and <a>lowercase ASCII letters</a>.
  For convenience, in this section this is just referred to as "case-insensitive".

<h4 id="the-doctype">The DOCTYPE</h4>

  A <dfn>DOCTYPE</dfn> is a
  required preamble.

  <p class="note">
  DOCTYPEs are required for legacy reasons. When omitted, browsers tend to use a
  different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications. Including the DOCTYPE in a
  document ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant
  specifications.
  </p>

  A DOCTYPE must consist of the following components, in this order:

  1. A string that is an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for the string "<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE</code>".
  2. One or more <a>space characters</a>.
  3. A string that is an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for the string "<code>html</code>".
  4. Optionally, a <a>DOCTYPE legacy string</a> or an <a>obsolete permitted DOCTYPE string</a> (defined below).
  5. Zero or more <a>space characters</a>.
  6. A U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN character (&gt;).

  <p class="note">
  In other words, <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html></code>, case-insensitively.
  </p>

  <hr />

  For the purposes of HTML generators that cannot output HTML markup with the short DOCTYPE
  "<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html></code>", a <dfn>DOCTYPE legacy string</dfn> may be inserted
  into the DOCTYPE (in the position defined above). This string must consist of:

  1. One or more <a>space characters</a>.
  2. A string that is an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for the string "<code>SYSTEM</code>".
  3. One or more <a>space characters</a>.
  4. A U+0022 QUOTATION MARK or U+0027 APOSTROPHE character (the <i>quote mark</i>).
  5. The literal string "<code>about:legacy-compat</code>".
  6. A matching U+0022 QUOTATION MARK or U+0027 APOSTROPHE character (i.e., the same character as in the earlier step labeled <i>quote mark</i>).

  <p class="note">
  In other words, <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "about:legacy-compat"></code> or
  <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM 'about:legacy-compat'></code>, case-insensitively except for the
  part in single or double quotes.
  </p>

  The <a>DOCTYPE legacy string</a> should not be used unless the document is generated from
  a system that cannot output the shorter string.

  <hr />

  To help authors transition from HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.1, an <dfn>obsolete permitted DOCTYPE
  string</dfn> can be inserted into the DOCTYPE (in the position defined above). This string must
  consist of:

  1. One or more <a>space characters</a>.
  2. A string that is an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for the string "<code>PUBLIC</code>".
  3. One or more <a>space characters</a>.
  4. A U+0022 QUOTATION MARK or U+0027 APOSTROPHE character (the <i>first quote mark</i>).
  5. The string from one of the cells in the first column of the table below. The row to which this cell belongs is the <i>selected row</i>.
  6. A matching U+0022 QUOTATION MARK or U+0027 APOSTROPHE character (i.e., the same character as in the earlier step labeled <i>first quote mark</i>).
  7. If a system identifier is used,
      1. One or more <a>space characters</a>.
      2. A U+0022 QUOTATION MARK or U+0027 APOSTROPHE character (the <i>third quote mark</i>).
      3. The string from the cell in the second column of the <i>selected row</i>.
      4. A matching U+0022 QUOTATION MARK or U+0027 APOSTROPHE character (i.e., the same character as in the earlier step labeled <i>third quote mark</i>).

  A <a>DOCTYPE</a> containing an <a>obsolete permitted DOCTYPE
  string</a> is an <dfn>obsolete permitted DOCTYPE</dfn>. Authors should not use <a>obsolete permitted DOCTYPEs</a>, as they are unnecessarily
  long.

<h4 id="writing-html-documents-elements">Elements</h4>

  There are five different <dfn lt="kind of element|kinds of elements">kinds of elements</dfn>:
  <a>void elements</a>, <a>raw text elements</a>, <a>escapable raw text elements</a>,
  <a>foreign elements</a>, and <a>normal elements</a>.

  <dl>

    <dt><dfn>Void elements</dfn></dt>

    <dd><{area}>, <{base}>, <{br}>, <{col}>, <{embed}>,
    <{hr}>, <{img}>, <{input}>, <{link}>,
    <{menuitem}>, <{meta}>, <{param}>, <{source}>,
    <{track}>, <{wbr}></dd>

    <dt><dfn lt="raw text|raw text elements">Raw text elements</dfn></dt>

    <dd><{script}>, <{style}></dd>

    <dt><dfn lt="escapable raw text|escapable raw text elements">escapable raw text elements</dfn></dt>

    <dd><{textarea}>, <{title}></dd>

    <dt><dfn>Foreign elements</dfn></dt>

    <dd>Elements from the <a>MathML namespace</a> and the <a>SVG namespace</a>.</dd>

    <dt><dfn lt="normal elements">Normal elements</dfn></dt>

    <dd>All other allowed <a>html elements</a> are normal elements.</dd>

  </dl>

  <dfn>Tags</dfn> are used to delimit the start and end of elements in the
  markup. <a>Raw text</a>, <a>escapable raw text</a>, and <a>normal elements</a> have
  a <a>start tag</a> to indicate where they begin, and an <a>end tag</a> to indicate where they end. The start and end tags of
  certain <a>normal elements</a> can be <a>omitted</a>, as
  described below in the section on <a lt="omitted">optional tags</a>. Those
  that cannot be omitted must not be omitted. <a>Void elements</a> only have a start tag; end
  tags must not be specified for <a>void elements</a>. <a>Foreign elements</a> must
  either have a start tag and an end tag, or a start tag that is marked as self-closing, in which
  case they must not have an end tag.

  The <a lt='html-contents'>contents</a> of the element must be placed between
  just after the start tag (which <a lt="omitted">might be implied, in certain
  cases</a>) and just before the end tag (which again, <a lt="omitted">might be
  implied, in certain cases</a>). The exact allowed contents of each individual element depend on
  the <a>content model</a> of that element, as described earlier in
  this specification. Elements must not contain content that their content model disallows. In
  addition to the restrictions placed on the contents by those content models, however, the five
  types of elements have additional <em>syntactic</em> requirements.

  <a>Void elements</a> can't have any contents (since there's no end tag, no content can be
  put between the start tag and the end tag).

  <a>Raw text elements</a> can have <a>text</a>, though it has <a>restrictions</a> described below.

  <a>Escapable raw text elements</a> can have <a>text</a> and
  <a>character references</a>, but the text must not contain an <a>ambiguous ampersand</a>. There are also <a>further restrictions</a> described below.

  <a>Foreign elements</a> whose start tag is marked as self-closing can't have any contents
  (since, again, as there's no end tag, no content can be put between the start tag and the end
  tag). <a>Foreign elements</a> whose start tag is <em>not</em> marked as self-closing can
  have <a>text</a>, <a>character
  references</a>, <a>CDATA sections</a>, other <a lt="kind of element">elements</a>, and
  <a>comments</a>, but the text must not contain the character U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN (&lt;) or an
  <a>ambiguous ampersand</a>.

  <div class="note">

    The HTML syntax does not support namespace declarations, even in <a>foreign
    elements</a>.

    For instance, consider the following HTML fragment:

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;p>
      &lt;svg>
      &lt;metadata>
        &lt;!-- this is invalid -->
        &lt;cdr:license xmlns:cdr="https://www.example.com/cdr/metadata" name="MIT"/>
      &lt;/metadata>
      &lt;/svg>
      &lt;/p>
    </pre>

    The innermost element, <code>cdr:license</code>, is actually in the <a>SVG namespace</a>, as
    the "<code>xmlns:cdr</code>" attribute has no effect (unlike in XML). In fact, as the
    comment in the fragment above says, the fragment is actually non-conforming. This is because the
    SVG specification does not define any elements called "<code>cdr:license</code>" in the
    <a>SVG namespace</a>.

  </div>

  <a>Normal elements</a> can have <a>text</a>, <a>character references</a>, other
  <a lt="kind of element">elements</a>, and <a>comments</a>, but
  the text must not contain the character U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN (&lt;) or an
  <a>ambiguous ampersand</a>. Some <a>normal elements</a>
  also have <a>yet more restrictions</a> on what content they are
  allowed to hold, beyond the restrictions imposed by the content model and those described in this
  paragraph. Those restrictions are described below.

  Tags contain a <dfn>tag name</dfn>, giving the element's name. HTML
  elements all have names that only use <a>alphanumeric ASCII characters</a>. In the HTML
  syntax, tag names, even those for <a>foreign elements</a>, may be written with any mix of
  lower- and uppercase letters that, when converted to all-lowercase, matches the element's tag
  name; tag names are case-insensitive.

<h5 id="start-tags">Start tags</h5>

  <dfn lt="start tag|start tags">Start tags</dfn> must have the following format:

  <ol>

    <li>The first character of a start tag must be a U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN character (&lt;).</li>

    <li>The next few characters of a start tag must be the element's <a>tag name</a>.</li>

    <li>If there are to be any attributes in the next step, there must first be one or more <a>space characters</a>.</li>

    <li>Then, the start tag may have a number of attributes, the <a>syntax for which</a> is described below. Attributes must be
    separated from each other by one or more <a>space
    characters</a>.</li>

    <li>After the attributes, or after the <a>tag name</a> if there are
    no attributes, there may be one or more <a>space characters</a>.
    (Some attributes are required to be followed by a space. See [[#elements-attributes]] below.)</li>

    <li>Then, if the element is one of the <a>void elements</a>, or if the element is a <a>foreign element</a>, then there may be a single U+002F SOLIDUS
    character (/). This character has no effect on <a>void elements</a>, but on <a>foreign
    elements</a> it marks the start tag as self-closing.</li>

    <li>Finally, start tags must be closed by a U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN character (&gt;).</li>

  </ol>

<h5 id="end-tags">End tags</h5>

  <dfn lt="end tag|end tags">End tags</dfn> must have the following format:

  <ol>

    <li>The first character of an end tag must be a U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN character (&lt;).</li>

    <li>The second character of an end tag must be a U+002F SOLIDUS character (/).</li>

    <li>The next few characters of an end tag must be the element's <a>tag
    name</a>.</li>

    <li>After the tag name, there may be one or more <a>space
    characters</a>.</li>

    <li>Finally, end tags must be closed by a U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN character (&gt;).</li>

  </ol>

<h5 id="elements-attributes">Attributes</h5>

  <dfn lt="attribute|attributes|syntax for which">Attributes</dfn> for an element are expressed inside the
  element's start tag.

  Attributes have a name and a value. <dfn lt="name|attribute name|names|attribute names">Attribute names</dfn>
  must consist of one or more characters other than the <a>space
  characters</a>, U+0000 NULL, U+0022 QUOTATION MARK (&#x22;), U+0027 APOSTROPHE (&#x27;), U+003E
  GREATER-THAN SIGN (&gt;), U+002F SOLIDUS (/), and U+003D EQUALS SIGN (=) characters, the <a>control
  characters</a>, and any characters that are not defined by Unicode. In the HTML syntax, attribute
  names, even those for <a>foreign elements</a>, may be written with any mix of lower- and
  uppercase letters that are an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for the attribute's
  name.

  <dfn lt="attribute value|attribute values">Attribute values</dfn> are a mixture of <a>text</a> and <a>character references</a>,
  except with the additional restriction that the text cannot contain an <a>ambiguous ampersand</a>.

  Attributes can be specified in four different ways:

  <dl>

    <dt>Empty attribute syntax</dt>

    <dd>

    Just the <a>attribute name</a>. The value is implicitly
    the empty string.

    <div class="example">
      In the following example, the <code>disabled</code> attribute is
      given with the empty attribute syntax:

      <pre highlight="html">
        &lt;input disabled&gt;
      </pre>
    </div>

    If an attribute using the empty attribute syntax is to be followed by another attribute, then
    there must be a <a>space character</a> separating the two.

    </dd>

    <dt><dfn lt="unquoted">Unquoted attribute value syntax</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    The <a>attribute name</a>, followed by zero or more <a>space characters</a>, followed by a single U+003D EQUALS SIGN
    character, followed by zero or more <a>space characters</a>,
    followed by the <a>attribute value</a>, which, in addition
    to the requirements given above for attribute values, must not contain any literal <a>space characters</a>, any U+0022 QUOTATION MARK characters (&#x22;),
    U+0027 APOSTROPHE characters (&#x27;), U+003D EQUALS SIGN characters (=), U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN
    characters (&lt;), U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN characters (&gt;), or U+0060 GRAVE ACCENT characters
    (`), and must not be the empty string.

    <div class="example">
      In the following example, the <code>value</code> attribute is given
      with the unquoted attribute value syntax:

      <pre highlight="html">
        &lt;input value=yes&gt;
      </pre>
    </div>

    If an attribute using the unquoted attribute syntax is to be followed by another attribute or
    by the optional U+002F SOLIDUS character (/) allowed in step 6 of the <a>start tag</a> syntax above, then there must be a <a>space
    character</a> separating the two.

    </dd>

    <dt>Single-quoted attribute value syntax</dt>

    <dd>

    The <a>attribute name</a>, followed by zero or more <a>space characters</a>, followed by a single U+003D EQUALS SIGN
    character, followed by zero or more <a>space characters</a>,
    followed by a single U+0027 APOSTROPHE character ('), followed by the <a>attribute value</a>, which, in addition to the requirements
    given above for attribute values, must not contain any literal U+0027 APOSTROPHE characters ('),
    and finally followed by a second single U+0027 APOSTROPHE character (').

    <div class="example">
      In the following example, the <code>type</code> attribute is given
      with the single-quoted attribute value syntax:

      <pre highlight="html">
        &lt;input type='checkbox'&gt;
      </pre>
    </div>

    If an attribute using the single-quoted attribute syntax is to be followed by another
    attribute, then there must be a <a>space character</a> separating the two.

    </dd>

    <dt>Double-quoted attribute value syntax</dt>

    <dd>

    The <a>attribute name</a>, followed by zero or more <a>space characters</a>, followed by a single U+003D EQUALS SIGN
    character, followed by zero or more <a>space characters</a>,
    followed by a single U+0022 QUOTATION MARK character ("), followed by the <a>attribute value</a>, which, in addition to the requirements
    given above for attribute values, must not contain any literal U+0022 QUOTATION MARK characters
    ("), and finally followed by a second single U+0022 QUOTATION MARK character (").

    <div class="example">
      In the following example, the <code>name</code> attribute is given with
      the double-quoted attribute value syntax:

      <pre highlight="html">
        &lt;input name="be evil"&gt;
      </pre>
    </div>

    If an attribute using the double-quoted attribute syntax is to be followed by another
    attribute, then there must be a <a>space character</a> separating the two.

    </dd>

  </dl>

  There must never be two or more attributes on the same start tag whose names are an
  <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for each other.

  <hr />

  When a <a>foreign element</a> has one of the namespaced
  attributes given by the local name and namespace of the first and second cells of a row from the
  following table, it must be written using the name given by the third cell from the same row.

  <table>
    <thead>
    <tr> <th> Local name <th> Namespace <th> Attribute name
    <tbody>
    <tr> <td> <code>actuate</code> <td> <a>XLink namespace</a> <td> <code>xlink:actuate</code>
    <tr> <td> <code>arcrole</code> <td> <a>XLink namespace</a> <td> <code>xlink:arcrole</code>
    <tr> <td> <code>href</code> <td> <a>XLink namespace</a> <td> <code>xlink:href</code>
    <tr> <td> <code>role</code> <td> <a>XLink namespace</a> <td> <code>xlink:role</code>
    <tr> <td> <code>show</code> <td> <a>XLink namespace</a> <td> <code>xlink:show</code>
    <tr> <td> <code>title</code> <td> <a>XLink namespace</a> <td> <code>xlink:title</code>
    <tr> <td> <code>type</code> <td> <a>XLink namespace</a> <td> <code>xlink:type</code>
    <tr> <td> <code>base</code> <td> <a>XML namespace</a>  <td> <{global/xml:base}>
    <tr> <td> <{global/lang}> <td> <a>XML namespace</a> <td> <{xml/lang|xml:lang}>
    <tr> <td> <code>space</code> <td> <a>XML namespace</a> <td> <code>xml:space</code>
    <tr> <td> <code>xmlns</code> <td> <a>XMLNS namespace</a> <td> <code>xmlns</code>
    <tr> <td> <code>xlink</code> <td> <a>XMLNS namespace</a> <td> <code>xmlns:xlink</code>
  </table>

  No other namespaced attribute can be expressed in <a href="#syntax">the HTML syntax</a>.

  <p class="note">
  Whether the attributes in the table above are conforming or not is defined by
  other specifications (e.g., the SVG and MathML specifications); this section only describes the
  syntax rules if the attributes are serialized using the HTML syntax.
  </p>

<h5 id="optional-tags">Optional tags</h5>

  Certain tags can be <dfn lt="optional start and end tags|omitted">omitted</dfn>.

  <p class="note">
  Omitting an element's <a>start tag</a> in the
  situations described below does not mean the element is not present; it is implied, but it is
  still there. For example, an HTML document always has an <{html}> element, even if
  the string <code>&lt;html></code> doesn't appear anywhere in the markup.
  </p>

  An <{html}> element's <a>start tag</a> may be omitted
  if the first thing inside the <{html}> element is not a <a>comment</a>.

  <div class="example">
    For example, in the following case it's ok to remove the "<code>&lt;html></code>"
    tag:

    <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>
  &lt;html>
  &lt;head>
    &lt;title>Hello&lt;/title>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    &lt;p>Welcome to this example.&lt;/p>
  &lt;/body>
  &lt;/html>
  </pre>

    Doing so would make the document look like this:

    <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>

  &lt;head>
    &lt;title>Hello&lt;/title>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    &lt;p>Welcome to this example.&lt;/p>
  &lt;/body>
  &lt;/html>
  </pre>

    This has the exact same DOM. In particular, note that white space around the <a>document element</a> is
    ignored by the parser. The following example would also have the exact same DOM:

    <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>&lt;head>
    &lt;title>Hello&lt;/title>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    &lt;p>Welcome to this example.&lt;/p>
  &lt;/body>
  &lt;/html>
  </pre>

    However, in the following example, removing the start tag moves the comment to before the
    <{html}> element:

    <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>
  &lt;html>
  &lt;!-- where is this comment in the DOM? -->
  &lt;head>
    &lt;title>Hello&lt;/title>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    &lt;p>Welcome to this example.&lt;/p>
  &lt;/body>
  &lt;/html>
  </pre>

    With the tag removed, the document actually turns into the same as this:

    <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>
  &lt;!-- where is this comment in the DOM? -->
  <small>&lt;html></small>
  &lt;head>
    &lt;title>Hello&lt;/title>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    &lt;p>Welcome to this example.&lt;/p>
  &lt;/body>
  &lt;/html>
  </pre>

    This is why the tag can only be removed if it is not followed by a comment: removing the tag
    when there is a comment there changes the document's resulting parse tree. Of course, if the
    position of the comment does not matter, then the tag can be omitted, as if the comment had been
    moved to before the start tag in the first place.
  </div>

  An <{html}> element's <a>end tag</a> may be omitted if
  the <{html}> element is not immediately followed by a <a>comment</a>.

  A <{head}> element's <a>start tag</a> may be omitted if
  the element is empty, or if the first thing inside the <{head}> element is an
  element.

  A <{head}> element's <a>end tag</a> may be omitted if the
  <{head}> element is not immediately followed by a <a>space character</a> or a <a>comment</a>.

  A <{body}> element's <a>start tag</a> may be omitted
  if the element is empty, or if the first thing inside the <{body}> element is not a
  <a>space character</a> or a <a>comment</a>, except if the
  first thing inside the <{body}> element is a <{meta}>, <{link}>,
  <{script}>, <{style}>, or <{template}> element.

  A <{body}> element's <a>end tag</a> may be omitted if the
  <{body}> element is not immediately followed by a <a>comment</a>.

  <div class="example">
    Note that in the example above, the <{head}> element start and end tags, and the
    <{body}> element start tag, can't be omitted, because they are surrounded by white
    space:

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>
      &lt;html>
        &lt;head>
          &lt;title>Hello&lt;/title>
        &lt;/head>
        &lt;body>
          &lt;p>Welcome to this example.&lt;/p>
        &lt;/body>
      &lt;/html>
    </pre>

    (The <code>body</code> and <{html}> element end tags could be omitted without
    trouble; any spaces after those get parsed into the <{body}> element anyway.)

    Usually, however, white space isn't an issue. If we first remove the white space we don't care
    about:

    <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>&lt;html>&lt;head>&lt;title>Hello&lt;/title>&lt;/head>&lt;body>&lt;p>Welcome to this example.&lt;/p>&lt;/body>&lt;/html>
  </pre>

    Then we can omit a number of tags without affecting the DOM:

    <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>&lt;title>Hello&lt;/title>&lt;p>Welcome to this example.&lt;/p>
  </pre>

    At that point, we can also add some white space back:

    <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>
  &lt;title>Hello&lt;/title>
  &lt;p>Welcome to this example.&lt;/p>
  </pre>

    This would be equivalent to this document, with the omitted tags shown in their
    parser-implied positions; the only white space text node that results from this is the newline at
    the end of the <{head}> element:

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>
      &lt;html>&lt;head>&lt;title>Hello&lt;/title>
      &lt;/head>&lt;body>&lt;p>Welcome to this example.&lt;/p>&lt;/body>&lt;/html>
    </pre>
  </div>

  An <{li}> element's <a>end tag</a> may be omitted if the
  <{li}> element is immediately followed by another <{li}> element or if there is
  no more content in the parent element.

  A <{dt}> element's <a>end tag</a> may be omitted if the
  <{dt}> element is immediately followed by another <{dt}> element or a
  <{dd}> element.

  A <{dd}> element's <a>end tag</a> may be omitted if the
  <{dd}> element is immediately followed by another <{dd}> element or a
  <{dt}> element, or if there is no more content in the parent element.

  A <{p}> element's <a>end tag</a> may be omitted if the
  <{p}> element is immediately followed by an <{address}>, <{article}>,
  <{aside}>, <{blockquote}>, <{details}>, <{div}>, <{dl}>,
  <{fieldset}>, <{figcaption}>, <{figure}>, <{footer}>, <{form}>, <{h1}>, <{h2}>,
  <{h3}>, <{h4}>, <{h5}>, <{h6}>, <{header}>,
  <{hr}>, <{main}>, <{menu}>, <{nav}>,
  <{ol}>, <{p}>, <{pre}>, <a element>section</a>, <{table}>, or
  <{ul}> element, or if there is no more content in the parent element and the parent
  element is an <a>HTML element</a> that is not an <{a}>, <{audio}>, <{del}>,
  <{ins}>, <{map}>, <{noscript}>, or <{video}> element.

  <div class="example">
    We can thus simplify the earlier example further:

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>&lt;title>Hello&lt;/title>&lt;p>Welcome to this example.&lt;/p>
    </pre>
  </div>

  An <{rt}> element's <a>end tag</a> may be omitted if the
  <{rt}> element is immediately followed by an <code>rt</code> or <{rp}> element,
  or if there is no more content in the parent element.

  An <{rp}> element's <a>end tag</a> may be omitted if the
  <{rp}> element is immediately followed by an <code>rt</code> or <{rp}> element,
  or if there is no more content in the parent element.

  An <{optgroup}> element's <a>end tag</a> may be omitted
  if the <{optgroup}> element  is
  immediately followed by another <{optgroup}> element, or if  there is no more content in
  the parent element.

  An <{option}> element's <a>end tag</a> may be omitted if
  the <{option}> element is immediately followed by another <{option}> element, or
  if it is immediately followed by an <{optgroup}> element, or if there is no more content
  in the parent element.

  A <{colgroup}> element's <a>start tag</a> may be
  omitted if the first thing inside the <{colgroup}> element is a <{col}> element,
  and if the element is not immediately preceded by another <{colgroup}> element whose
  <a>end tag</a> has been omitted. (It can't be omitted if the element
  is empty.)

  A <{colgroup}> element's <a>end tag</a> may be omitted if
  the <{colgroup}> element is not immediately followed by a <a>space character</a> or
  a <a>comment</a>.

  A <{caption}> element's <a>end tag</a> may be omitted if
  the <{caption}> element is not immediately followed by a <a>space character</a> or
  a <a>comment</a>.

  A <{thead}> element's <a>end tag</a> may be omitted if
  the <{thead}> element is immediately followed by a <code>tbody</code> or
  <{tfoot}> element.

  A <{tbody}> element's <a>start tag</a> may be omitted
  if the first thing inside the <{tbody}> element is a <{tr}> element, and if the
  element is not immediately preceded by a <{tbody}>, <{thead}>, or
  <{tfoot}> element whose <a>end tag</a> has been omitted. (It
  can't be omitted if the element is empty.)

  A <{tbody}> element's <a>end tag</a> may be omitted if
  the <{tbody}> element is immediately followed by a <code>tbody</code> or
  <{tfoot}> element, or if there is no more content in the parent element.

  A <{tfoot}> element's <a>end tag</a> may be omitted if
  the <{tfoot}> element is immediately followed by a <{tbody}> element, or if
  there is no more content in the parent element.

  A <{tr}> element's <a>end tag</a> may be omitted if the
  <{tr}> element is immediately followed by another <{tr}> element, or if there is
  no more content in the parent element.

  A <{td}> element's <a>end tag</a> may be omitted if the
  <{td}> element is immediately followed by a <code>td</code> or <{th}> element,
  or if there is no more content in the parent element.

  A <{th}> element's <a>end tag</a> may be omitted if the
  <{th}> element is immediately followed by a <code>td</code> or <{th}> element,
  or if there is no more content in the parent element.

  <div class="example">
    The ability to omit all these table-related tags makes table markup much terser.

    Take this example:

    <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;table>
  &lt;caption>37547 TEE Electric Powered Rail Car Train Functions (Abbreviated)&lt;/caption>
  &lt;colgroup>&lt;col>&lt;col>&lt;col>&lt;/colgroup>
  &lt;thead>
  &lt;tr>
    &lt;th>Function&lt;/th>
    &lt;th>Control Unit&lt;/th>
    &lt;th>Central Station&lt;/th>
  &lt;/tr>
  &lt;/thead>
  &lt;tbody>
  &lt;tr>
    &lt;td>Headlights&lt;/td>
    &lt;td>&#x2714;&lt;/td>
    &lt;td>&#x2714;&lt;/td>
  &lt;/tr>
  &lt;tr>
    &lt;td>Interior Lights&lt;/td>
    &lt;td>&#x2714;&lt;/td>
    &lt;td>&#x2714;&lt;/td>
  &lt;/tr>
  &lt;tr>
    &lt;td>Electric locomotive operating sounds&lt;/td>
    &lt;td>&#x2714;&lt;/td>
    &lt;td>&#x2714;&lt;/td>
  &lt;/tr>
  &lt;tr>
    &lt;td>Engineer's cab lighting&lt;/td>
    &lt;td>&lt;/td>
    &lt;td>&#x2714;&lt;/td>
  &lt;/tr>
  &lt;tr>
    &lt;td>Station Announcements - Swiss&lt;/td>
    &lt;td>&lt;/td>
    &lt;td>&#x2714;&lt;/td>
  &lt;/tr>
  &lt;/tbody>
  &lt;/table>
  </pre>

    The exact same table, modulo some white space differences, could be marked up as follows:

    <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;table>
  &lt;caption>37547 TEE Electric Powered Rail Car Train Functions (Abbreviated)
  &lt;colgroup>&lt;col>&lt;col>&lt;col>
  &lt;thead>
  &lt;tr>
    &lt;th>Function
    &lt;th>Control Unit
    &lt;th>Central Station
  &lt;tbody>
  &lt;tr>
    &lt;td>Headlights
    &lt;td>&#x2714;
    &lt;td>&#x2714;
  &lt;tr>
    &lt;td>Interior Lights
    &lt;td>&#x2714;
    &lt;td>&#x2714;
  &lt;tr>
    &lt;td>Electric locomotive operating sounds
    &lt;td>&#x2714;
    &lt;td>&#x2714;
  &lt;tr>
    &lt;td>Engineer's cab lighting
    &lt;td>
    &lt;td>&#x2714;
  &lt;tr>
    &lt;td>Station Announcements - Swiss
    &lt;td>
    &lt;td>&#x2714;
  &lt;/table>
  </pre>

    Since the cells take up much less room this way, this can be made even terser by having each
    row on one line:

    <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;table>
  &lt;caption>37547 TEE Electric Powered Rail Car Train Functions (Abbreviated)
  &lt;colgroup>&lt;col>&lt;col>&lt;col>
  &lt;thead>
  &lt;tr> &lt;th>Function                              &lt;th>Control Unit     &lt;th>Central Station
  &lt;tbody>
  &lt;tr> &lt;td>Headlights                            &lt;td>&#x2714;                &lt;td>&#x2714;
  &lt;tr> &lt;td>Interior Lights                       &lt;td>&#x2714;                &lt;td>&#x2714;
  &lt;tr> &lt;td>Electric locomotive operating sounds  &lt;td>&#x2714;                &lt;td>&#x2714;
  &lt;tr> &lt;td>Engineer's cab lighting               &lt;td>                 &lt;td>&#x2714;
  &lt;tr> &lt;td>Station Announcements - Swiss         &lt;td>                 &lt;td>&#x2714;
  &lt;/table>
  </pre>

    The only differences between these tables, at the DOM level, is with the precise position of
    the (in any case semantically-neutral) white space.
  </div>

  <strong>However</strong>, a <a>start tag</a> must never be
  omitted if it has any attributes.

  <div class="example">
    Returning to the earlier example with all the white space removed and then all the optional
    tags removed:

    <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>&lt;title>Hello&lt;/title>&lt;p>Welcome to this example.
  </pre>

    If the <{body}> element in this example had to have a <code>class</code> attribute and the <{html}> element had to have a <{global/lang}> attribute, the markup would have to become:

    <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>&lt;html lang="en">&lt;title>Hello&lt;/title>&lt;body class="demo">&lt;p>Welcome to this example.
  </pre>
  </div>

  <p class="note">
  This section assumes that the document is conforming, in particular, that there
  are no <a>content model</a> violations. Omitting tags in the fashion
  described in this section in a document that does not conform to the <a>content models</a>
  described in this specification is likely to result in unexpected DOM differences (this is, in
  part, what the content models are designed to avoid).
  </p>

<h5 id="restrictions-on-content-models"><dfn lt="yet more restrictions">Restrictions on content models</dfn></h5>

  For historical reasons, certain elements have extra restrictions beyond even the restrictions
  given by their content model.

  A <{table}> element must not contain <{tr}> elements, even though these
  elements are technically allowed inside <{table}> elements according to the content
  models described in this specification. (If a <{tr}> element is put inside a
  <code>table</code> in the markup, it will in fact imply a <code>tbody</code> start tag before
  it.)

  A single <a href="#newlines">newline</a> may be placed immediately after the <a>start tag</a> of <code>pre</code> and <{textarea}> elements.
  This does not affect the processing of the element. The otherwise optional <a href="#newlines">newline</a> <em>must</em> be included if the element's contents
  themselves start with a <a href="#newlines">newline</a> (because otherwise the
  leading newline in the contents would be treated like the optional newline, and ignored).

  <div class="example">
    The following two <code>pre</code> blocks are equivalent:
    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;pre>Hello&lt;/pre>
    </pre>
    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;pre>
      Hello&lt;/pre>
    </pre>
  </div>

<h5 id="restrictions-on-the-contents-of-raw-text-and-escapable-raw-text-elements"><dfn lt="restrictions|restrictions on the contents of raw text and escapable raw text elements|further restrictions">Restrictions on the contents of raw text and escapable raw text elements</dfn></h5>

  The text in <a>raw text</a> and <a>escapable raw text
  elements</a> must not contain any occurrences of the string "<code>&lt;/</code>"
  (U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN, U+002F SOLIDUS) followed by characters that case-insensitively match the
  tag name of the element followed by one of U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab), U+000A LINE FEED
  (LF), U+000C FORM FEED (FF), U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR), U+0020 SPACE, U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN
  (>), or U+002F SOLIDUS (/).

<h4 id="writing-text">Text</h4>

  Text is allowed inside elements, attribute values, and comments.
  Extra constraints are placed on what is and what is not allowed in text based on where the text is
  to be put, as described in the other sections.

<h5 id="newlines">Newlines</h5>

  Newlines in HTML may be represented either as U+000D
  CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters, U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters, or pairs of U+000D CARRIAGE
  RETURN (CR), U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters in that order.

  Where <a>character references</a> are allowed, a character
  reference of a U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character (but not a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) character)
  also represents a <a href="#newlines">newline</a>.

<h4 id="sec-character-references">Character references</h4>

  In certain cases described in other sections, <a>text</a> may be
  mixed with <dfn>character references</dfn>. These can be used to escape
  characters that couldn't otherwise legally be included in <a>text</a>.

  Character references must start with a U+0026 AMPERSAND character (&amp;). Following this,
  there are three possible kinds of character references:

  <dl>

    <dt>Named character references</dt>

    <dd>The ampersand must be followed by one of the names given in [[#named-character-references]] section, using the same case. <span class="impl">The name must be one that is
    terminated by a U+003B SEMICOLON character (;).</span></dd>

    <dt>Decimal numeric character reference</dt>

    <dd>The ampersand must be followed by a U+0023 NUMBER SIGN character (#), followed by one or more
    <a>ASCII digits</a>, representing a base-ten integer that corresponds to a Unicode code
    point that is allowed according to the definition below. The digits must then be followed by a
    U+003B SEMICOLON character (;).</dd>

    <dt>Hexadecimal numeric character reference</dt>

    <dd>The ampersand must be followed by a U+0023 NUMBER SIGN character (#), which must be followed
    by either a U+0078 LATIN SMALL LETTER X character (x) or a U+0058 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER X
    character (X), which must then be followed by one or more <a>ASCII hex digits</a>,
    representing a hexadecimal integer that corresponds to a Unicode code point that is allowed
    according to the definition below. The digits must then be followed by a U+003B SEMICOLON
    character (;).</dd>

  </dl>

  The numeric character reference forms described above are allowed to reference any Unicode code
  point other than U+0000, U+000D, permanently undefined Unicode characters (noncharacters),
  surrogates (U+D800&ndash;U+DFFF), and <a>control characters</a> other than <a>space characters</a>.

  An <dfn>ambiguous ampersand</dfn> is a U+0026 AMPERSAND
  character (&amp;) that is followed by one or more <a>alphanumeric ASCII characters</a>,
  followed by a U+003B SEMICOLON character (;), where these characters do not match any of the names
  given in the [[#named-character-references]] section.

<h4 id="sec-cdata-sections">CDATA sections</h4>

  <dfn>CDATA sections</dfn> must consist of the following components, in
  this order:

  <ol>

    <li>The string "<code>&lt;![CDATA[</code>".</li>

    <li>Optionally, <a>text</a>, with the additional restriction that the
    text must not contain the string "<code>]]&gt;</code>".</li>

    <li>The string "<code>]]&gt;</code>".</li>

  </ol>

  <div class="example">
    CDATA sections can only be used in foreign content (MathML or SVG). In this example, a CDATA
    section is used to escape the contents of an <a>MathML <code>ms</code></a> element:

    <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;p>You can add a string to a number, but this stringifies the number:&lt;/p>
  &lt;math>
  &lt;ms>&lt;![CDATA[x&lt;y]]>&lt;/ms>
  &lt;mo>+&lt;/mo>
  &lt;mn>3&lt;/mn>
  &lt;mo>=&lt;/mo>
  &lt;ms>&lt;![CDATA[x&lt;y3]]>&lt;/ms>
  &lt;/math>
  </pre>
  </div>

<h4 id="sec-comments">Comments</h4>

  <dfn lt="comment|comments">Comments</dfn> must start with the four character sequence U+003C
  LESS-THAN SIGN, U+0021 EXCLAMATION MARK, U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS (<code>&lt;!--</code>). Following this sequence, the comment may have <a>text</a>, with the additional restriction that the text must not start with
  a single U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN character (&gt;), nor start with a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS character
  (-) followed by a U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN (&gt;) character, nor contain two consecutive U+002D
  HYPHEN-MINUS characters (<code>--</code>), nor end with a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS character
  (-). Finally, the comment must be ended by the three character sequence U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS,
  U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN (<code>--&gt;</code>).

<h3 id="parsing-html-documents">Parsing HTML documents</h3>

  <i>This section only applies to user agents, data mining tools, and conformance
  checkers.</i>

  <p class="note">
  The rules for parsing XML documents into DOM trees are covered by the next
  section, entitled "<a href="#xhtml">the XHTML syntax</a>".
  </p>

  User agents must use the parsing rules described in this section to generate the DOM trees from
  <a href="#text-html"><code>text/html</code></a> resources. Together, these rules define what is referred to as the
  <dfn>HTML parser</dfn>.

  <div class="note">

    While the HTML syntax described in this specification bears a close resemblance to SGML and
    XML, it is a separate language with its own parsing rules.

    Some earlier versions of HTML (in particular from HTML 2.0 to HTML 4.01) were based on SGML and used
    SGML parsing rules. However, few (if any) web browsers ever implemented true SGML parsing for
    HTML documents; the only user agents to strictly handle HTML as an SGML application have
    historically been validators. The resulting confusion &mdash; with validators claiming documents
    to have one representation while widely deployed Web browsers interoperably implemented a
    different representation &mdash; has wasted decades of productivity. This version of HTML thus
    returns to a non-SGML basis.

    Authors interested in using SGML tools in their authoring pipeline are encouraged to use XML
    tools and the XML serialization of HTML.

  </div>

  This specification defines the parsing rules for HTML documents, whether they are syntactically
  correct or not. Certain points in the parsing algorithm are said to be
  <dfn for="parser" lt="parse error|parse errors">parse errors</dfn>. The error handling for
  parse errors is well-defined (that's the
  processing rules described throughout this specification), but user agents, while parsing an HTML
  document, may <a>abort the parser</a> at the first <a for="parser">parse error</a> that they
  encounter for which they do not wish to apply the rules described in this
  specification.

  Conformance checkers must report at least one <a for="parser">parse error</a> condition to the user if one or more
  <a for="parser">parse error</a> conditions exist in the document and must not report <a for="parser">parse error</a> conditions if none
  exist in the document. Conformance checkers may report more than one <a for="parser">parse error</a> condition if more
  than one <a for="parser">parse error</a> condition exists in the document.

  <p class="note">
  <a for="parser">Parse errors</a> are only errors with the <em>syntax</em> of HTML. In addition to
  checking for <a for="parser">parse errors</a>, conformance checkers will also verify that the document obeys all the
  other conformance requirements described in this specification.
  </p>

  For the purposes of conformance checkers, if a resource is determined to be in <a href="#syntax">the HTML syntax</a>, then it is an <a>HTML document</a>.

  <p class="note">
  As stated in the terminology
  section, references to <a>element types</a> that do not
  explicitly specify a namespace always refer to elements in the <a>HTML namespace</a>. For
  example, if the spec talks about "a <{menuitem}> element", then that is an element with
  the local name "<{menuitem}>", the namespace "<code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>", and the interface {{HTMLMenuItemElement}}.
  Where possible, references to such elements are hyperlinked to their definition.

  <object data="images/parsing-model-overview.svg" width="345" height="535"><img src="images/parsing-model-overview.png" width="345" height="450" alt="" /></object>

  The input to the HTML parsing process consists of a stream of <a>Unicode code points</a>, which is passed through a <a>tokenization</a> stage
  followed by a tree construction stage. The output is a {{Document}}
  object.

  <p class="note">
  Implementations that <a>do not support scripting</a> do not
  have to actually create a DOM <code>Document</code> object, but the DOM tree in such cases is
  still used as the model for the rest of the specification.
  </p>

  In the common case, the data handled by the tokenization stage comes from the network, but
  <a>it can also come from script</a> running in the user
  agent, e.g., using the <a method lt="write()"><code>document.write()</code></a> API.

  There is only one set of states for the tokenizer stage and the tree
  construction stage, but the tree construction stage is <dfn>reentrant</dfn>, meaning that while the tree
  construction stage is handling one token, the tokenizer might be resumed, causing further tokens
  to be emitted and processed before the first token's processing is complete.

  <div class="example">
    In the following example, the tree construction stage will be called upon to handle a "p"
    start tag token while handling the "script" end tag token:

    <pre highlight="html">
  ...
  &lt;script>
  document.write('&lt;p>');
  &lt;/script>
  ...
  </pre>
  </div>

  To handle these cases, parsers have a <dfn>script nesting level</dfn>, which must be initially
  set to zero, and a <dfn>parser pause flag</dfn>, which must be initially set to false.

  </div>

  <div class="impl">

<h4 id="the-input-byte-stream">The <dfn>input byte stream</dfn></h4>

  The stream of Unicode code points that comprizes the input to the tokenization stage will be
  initially seen by the user agent as a stream of bytes (typically coming over the network or from
  the local file system). The bytes encode the actual characters according to a particular
  <i>character encoding</i>, which the user agent uses to decode the bytes into characters.

  <p class="note">
  For XML documents, the algorithm user agents are required to use to determine the
  character encoding is given by the XML specification. This section does not apply to XML
  documents. [[!XML]]
  </p>

  Usually, the <a>encoding sniffing algorithm</a> defined below is used to determine the
  character encoding.

  Given a character encoding, the bytes in the <a>input byte stream</a> must be converted to
  characters for the tokenizer's <a>input stream</a>, by passing the <a>input byte stream</a> and
  character encoding to <a>decode</a>.

  <p class="note">A leading Byte Order Mark (BOM) causes the character encoding argument to be
  ignored and will itself be skipped.</p>

  <p class="note">
  Bytes or sequences of bytes in the original byte stream that did not conform to
  the Encoding standard (e.g., invalid UTF-8 byte sequences in a UTF-8 input byte stream) are errors
  that conformance checkers are expected to report. [[!ENCODING]]
  </p>

  <p class="warning">The decoder algorithms describe how to handle invalid input; for security
  reasons, it is imperative that those rules be followed precisely. Differences in how invalid byte
  sequences are handled can result in, amongst other problems, script injection vulnerabilities
  ("XSS").</p>

  When the HTML parser is decoding an input byte stream, it uses a character encoding and a <dfn>confidence</dfn>. The confidence is either <i>tentative</i>,
  <i>certain</i>, or <i>irrelevant</i>. The encoding used, and whether the confidence in that
  encoding is <i>tentative</i> or <i>certain</i>, is <a>used during the parsing</a> to determine whether to <a>change the encoding</a>. If no encoding is
  necessary, e.g., because the parser is operating on a Unicode stream and doesn't have to use a
  character encoding at all, then the <a>confidence</a> is
  <i>irrelevant</i>.

  <p class="note">
  Some algorithms feed the parser by directly adding characters to the <a>input
  stream</a> rather than adding bytes to the <a>input byte stream</a>.
  </p>

<h5 id="parsing-with-a-known-character-encoding">Parsing with a known character encoding</h5>

  When the HTML parser is to operate on an input byte stream that has <dfn>a known definite
  encoding</dfn>, then the character encoding is that encoding and the <a>confidence</a> is <i>certain</i>.

<h5 id="determining-the-character-encoding">Determining the character encoding</h5>

  In some cases, it might be impractical to unambiguously determine the encoding before parsing
  the document. Because of this, this specification provides for a two-pass mechanism with an
  optional pre-scan. Implementations are allowed, as described below, to apply a simplified parsing
  algorithm to whatever bytes they have available before beginning to parse the document. Then, the
  real parser is started, using a tentative encoding derived from this pre-parse and other
  out-of-band metadata. If, while the document is being loaded, the user agent discovers a character
  encoding declaration that conflicts with this information, then the parser can get reinvoked to
  perform a parse of the document with the real encoding.

  User agents must use the following algorithm, called the <dfn>encoding
  sniffing algorithm</dfn>, to determine the character encoding to use when decoding a document in
  the first pass. This algorithm takes as input any out-of-band metadata available to the user agent
  (e.g., the <a>Content-Type metadata</a> of the document) and all the
  bytes available so far, and returns a character encoding and a <a>confidence</a> that is either <i>tentative</i> or
  <i>certain</i>.

  <ol>

    <li>

    If the user has explicitly instructed the user agent to override the document's character
    encoding with a specific encoding, optionally return that encoding with the <a>confidence</a> <i>certain</i> and abort these steps.

    <p class="note">
  Typically, user agents remember such user requests across sessions, and in some
    cases apply them to documents in <code>iframe</code>s as well.
  </p>

    </li>

    <li>

    The user agent may wait for more bytes of the resource to be available, either in this step
    or at any later step in this algorithm. For instance, a user agent might wait 500ms or 1024
    bytes, whichever came first. In general preparsing the source to find the encoding improves
    performance, as it reduces the need to throw away the data structures used when parsing upon
    finding the encoding information. However, if the user agent delays too long to obtain data to
    determine the encoding, then the cost of the delay could outweigh any performance improvements
    from the preparse.

    <p class="note">
  The authoring conformance requirements for character encoding declarations limit
    them to only appearing <a lt="the first 1024 bytes">in the first 1024 bytes</a>. User agents are
    therefore encouraged to use the prescan algorithm below (as invoked by these steps) on the first
    1024 bytes, but not to stall beyond that.
  </p>

    </li>

    <li>If the transport layer specifies a character encoding, and it is supported, return that
    encoding with the <a>confidence</a> <i>certain</i>, and
    abort these steps.</li>

    <li>

    Optionally <a>prescan the byte
    stream to determine its encoding</a>. The <var>end condition</var> is that the user
    agent decides that scanning further bytes would not be efficient. User agents are encouraged to
    only prescan the first 1024 bytes. User agents may decide that scanning <em>any</em> bytes is
    not efficient, in which case these substeps are entirely skipped.

    The aforementioned algorithm either aborts unsuccessfully or returns a character encoding. If
    it returns a character encoding, then this algorithm must be aborted, returning the same
    encoding, with <a>confidence</a> <i>tentative</i>.

    </li>

    <li>

    If the <a>HTML parser</a> for which this algorithm is being run is associated with a
    {{Document}} that is itself in a <a>nested browsing context</a>, run these
    substeps:

    <ol>

      <li>Let <var>new document</var> be the <code>Document</code> with which the
      <a>HTML parser</a> is associated.</li>

      <li>Let <var>parent document</var> be the <code>Document</code> <a>through which <var>new document</var> is
      nested</a> (the <a>active document</a> of the <a>parent browsing context</a> of
      <var>new document</var>).</li>

      <li>If <var>parent document</var>'s <a for="concept">origin</a> is not the <a>same
      origin</a> as <var>new document</var>'s <a for="concept">origin</a>, then abort these
      substeps.</li>

      <li>If <var>parent document</var>'s <a>character encoding</a> is not an <a>ASCII-compatible encoding</a>, then
      abort these substeps.</li>

      <li>Return <var>parent document</var>'s <a>character encoding</a>, with the <a>confidence</a> <i>tentative</i>, and abort the
      <a>encoding sniffing algorithm</a>'s steps.</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    <li>Otherwise, if the user agent has information on the likely encoding for this page, e.g.,
    based on the encoding of the page when it was last visited, then return that encoding, with the
    <a>confidence</a> <i>tentative</i>, and abort these
    steps.</li>

    <li>

    The user agent may attempt to autodetect the character encoding from applying frequency
    analysis or other algorithms to the data stream. Such algorithms may use information about the
    resource other than the resource's contents, including the address of the resource. If
    autodetection succeeds in determining a character encoding, and that encoding is a supported
    encoding, then return that encoding, with the <a>confidence</a> <i>tentative</i>, and abort these steps.
    [[UNIVCHARDET]]

    <p class="note">
  User agents are generally discouraged from attempting to autodetect encodings
    for resources obtained over the network, since doing so involves inherently non-interoperable
    heuristics. Attempting to detect encodings based on an HTML document's preamble is especially
    tricky since HTML markup typically uses only ASCII characters, and HTML documents tend to begin
    with a lot of markup rather than with text content.
  </p>

    <p class="note">
  The UTF-8 encoding has a highly detectable bit pattern. Files from the local
    file system that contain bytes with values greater than 0x7F which match the UTF-8 pattern are
    very likely to be UTF-8, while documents with byte sequences that do not match it are very
    likely not. When a user agent can examine the whole file, rather than just the preamble,
    detecting for UTF-8 specifically can be especially effective. [[PPUTF8]] [[UTF8DET]]
  </p>

    </li>

    <li>

    Otherwise, return an implementation-defined or user-specified default character encoding,
    with the <a>confidence</a> <i>tentative</i>.

    In controlled environments or in environments where the encoding of documents can be
    prescribed (for example, for user agents intended for dedicated use in new networks), the
    comprehensive <code>UTF-8</code> encoding is suggested.

    In other environments, the default encoding is typically dependent on the user's locale (an
    approximation of the languages, and thus often encodings, of the pages that the user is likely
    to frequent). The following table gives suggested defaults based on the user's locale, for
    compatibility with legacy content. Locales are identified by BCP 47 language tags. [[!BCP47]] [[!ENCODING]]

  For the sake of interoperability, user agents should not use a pre-scan algorithm that returns
  different results than the one described above. (But, if you do, please at least let us know, so
  that we can improve this algorithm and benefit everyone...)

<h5 id="character-encodings">Character encodings</h5>

  User agents must support the encodings defined in the WHATWG Encoding standard, including, but not
  limited to,

  <dfn>UTF-8</dfn>,
  <dfn>ISO-8859-2</dfn>,
  <dfn>ISO-8859-8</dfn>,

  User agents must not support other encodings.

  <p class="note">
  The above prohibits supporting, for example, CESU-8, UTF-7, BOCU-1, SCSU, EBCDIC,
  and UTF-32. This specification does not make any attempt to support prohibited encodings in its
  algorithms; support and use of prohibited encodings would thus lead to unexpected behavior. [[CESU8]] [[RFC2152]] [[BOCU1]] [[SCSU]]
  </p>

<h5 id="changing-the-encoding-while-parsing">Changing the encoding while parsing</h5>

  When the parser requires the user agent to <dfn>change the encoding</dfn>, it must run the
  following steps. This might happen if the <a>encoding sniffing algorithm</a> described above
  failed to find a character encoding, or if it found a character encoding that was not the actual
  encoding of the file.

  <ol>

    <li>If the encoding that is already being used to interpret the input stream is a <a>UTF-16
    encoding</a>, then set the <a>confidence</a> to
    <i>certain</i> and abort these steps. The new encoding is ignored; if it was anything but the
    same encoding, then it would be clearly incorrect.</li>

    <li>If the new encoding is a <a>UTF-16 encoding</a>, then change it to <a>UTF-8</a>.</li>

    <li>If the new encoding is the <a>x-user-defined</a> encoding, then change it to
    <a>Windows-1252</a>. [[!ENCODING]]</li>

    <li>If the new encoding is identical or equivalent to the encoding that is already being used
    to interpret the input stream, then set the <a>confidence</a> to <i>certain</i> and abort these steps.
    This happens when the encoding information found in the file matches what the <a>encoding
    sniffing algorithm</a> determined to be the encoding, and in the second pass through the
    parser if the first pass found that the encoding sniffing algorithm described in the earlier
    section failed to find the right encoding.</li>

    <li>If all the bytes up to the last byte converted by the current decoder have the same
    Unicode interpretations in both the current encoding and the new encoding, and if the user agent
    supports changing the converter on the fly, then the user agent may change to the new converter
    for the encoding on the fly. Set the <a>document's character encoding</a> and the encoding
    used to convert the input stream to the new encoding, set the <a>confidence</a> to <i>certain</i>, and abort these
    steps.</li>

    <li>Otherwise, <a>navigate</a> to the document again, with
    <a>replacement enabled</a>, and using the same <a>source browsing context</a>, but
    this time skip the <a>encoding sniffing algorithm</a> and instead just set the encoding to
    the new encoding and the <a>confidence</a> to
    <i>certain</i>. Whenever possible, this should be done without actually contacting the network
    layer (the bytes should be re-parsed from memory), even if, e.g., the document is marked as not
    being cacheable. If this is not possible and contacting the network layer would involve repeating
    a request that uses a method other than <code>GET</code>), then instead set the <a>confidence</a> to <i>certain</i> and ignore the new
    encoding. The resource will be misinterpreted. User agents may notify the user of the situation,
    to aid in application development.</li>

  </ol>

  <p class="note">
  This algorithm is only invoked when a new encoding is found declared on a
  <{meta}> element.
  </p>

<h5 id="preprocessing-the-input-stream">Preprocessing the input stream</h5>

  The <dfn>input stream</dfn> consists of the characters pushed into it as the <a>input byte
  stream</a> is decoded or from the various APIs that directly manipulate the input stream.

  Any occurrences of any characters in the ranges U+0001 to U+0008,    U+000E to U+001F,
  U+007F  to U+009F, U+FDD0 to U+FDEF, and
  characters U+000B, U+FFFE, U+FFFF, U+1FFFE, U+1FFFF, U+2FFFE, U+2FFFF, U+3FFFE, U+3FFFF, U+4FFFE,
  U+4FFFF, U+5FFFE, U+5FFFF, U+6FFFE, U+6FFFF, U+7FFFE, U+7FFFF, U+8FFFE, U+8FFFF, U+9FFFE, U+9FFFF,
  U+AFFFE, U+AFFFF, U+BFFFE, U+BFFFF, U+CFFFE, U+CFFFF, U+DFFFE, U+DFFFF, U+EFFFE, U+EFFFF, U+FFFFE,
  U+FFFFF, U+10FFFE, and U+10FFFF are <a for="parser">parse errors</a>. These are all
  <a>control characters</a> or permanently undefined Unicode characters (noncharacters).

  Any <a>character</a> that is a not a <a>Unicode character</a>, i.e., any isolated
  surrogate, is a <a for="parser">parse error</a>. (These can only find their way into the input stream via
  script APIs such as <a method lt="write()"><code>document.write()</code></a>.)

  U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters and U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters are treated
  specially. Any LF character that immediately follows a CR character must be ignored, and all CR
  characters must then be converted to LF characters. Thus, newlines in HTML DOMs are represented by
  LF characters, and there are never any CR characters in the input to the <a>tokenization</a>
  stage.

  The <dfn>next input character</dfn> is the first character in the <a>input stream</a>
  that has not yet been <dfn>consumed</dfn> or explicitly ignored by the requirements in
  this section. Initially, the <a>next input character</a> is the
  first character in the input. The <dfn>current input character</dfn> is the last character to have
  been <i>consumed</i>.

  The <dfn>insertion point</dfn> is the position (just before a character or just before the end
  of the input stream) where content inserted using <a method lt="write()"><code>document.write()</code></a> is actually inserted. The insertion point is
  relative to the position of the character immediately after it, it is not an absolute offset into
  the input stream. Initially, the insertion point is undefined.

  The "EOF" character in the tables below is a conceptual character representing the end of the
  <a>input stream</a>. If the parser is a <a>script-created parser</a>, then the end of
  the <a>input stream</a> is reached when an <dfn>explicit "EOF" character</dfn> (inserted by
  the <code>document.close()</code> method) is consumed. Otherwise, the
  "EOF" character is not a real character in the stream, but rather the lack of any further
  characters.

  <p class="note">
  The handling of U+0000 NULL characters varies based on where the characters are
  found. In general, they are ignored except where doing so could plausibly introduce an attack
  vector. This handling is, by necessity, spread across both the tokenization stage and the tree
  construction stage.

  <div class="impl">

<h4 id="parse-state">Parse state</h4>

<h5 id="the-insertion-mode">The insertion mode</h5>

  The <dfn>insertion mode</dfn> is a state variable that controls the primary operation of the
  tree construction stage.

  Initially, the <a>insertion mode</a> is "<a>initial</a>". It can change to "<a>before
  html</a>", "<a>before head</a>", "<a>in head</a>", "<a>in head noscript</a>", "<a>after head</a>",
  "<a>in body</a>", "<a lt="the text insertion mode">text</a>", "<a>in table</a>", "<a>in table text</a>", "<a>in caption</a>", "<a>in column
  group</a>", "<a>in table body</a>", "<a>in row</a>", "<a>in
  cell</a>", "<a>in select</a>", "<a>in select in table</a>", "<a>in template</a>", "<a>after body</a>",
  "<a>in frameset</a>", "<a>after frameset</a>", "<a>after
  after body</a>", and "<a>after after
  frameset</a>" during the course of the parsing, as described in the tree
  construction stage. The insertion mode affects how tokens are processed and whether CDATA
  sections are supported.

  Several of these modes, namely "<a>in head</a>", "<a>in body</a>", "<a>in
  table</a>", and "<a>in select</a>", are special, in
  that the other modes defer to them at various times. When the algorithm below says that the user
  agent is to do something "<dfn>using the rules for</dfn> the <var>m</var> insertion
  mode", where <var>m</var> is one of these modes, the user agent must use the rules
  described under the <var>m</var> <a>insertion mode</a>'s section, but must leave
  the <a>insertion mode</a> unchanged unless the rules in <var>m</var> themselves
  switch the <a>insertion mode</a> to a new value.

  When the insertion mode is switched to "<a lt="the text insertion mode">text</a>" or
  "<a>in table text</a>", the <dfn>original insertion
  mode</dfn> is also set. This is the insertion mode to which the tree construction stage will
  return.

  Similarly, to parse nested <{template}> elements, a <dfn>stack of template insertion
  modes</dfn> is used. It is initially empty. The <dfn>current template insertion mode</dfn> is the
  insertion mode that was most recently added to the <a>stack of template insertion modes</a>.
  The algorithms in the sections below will <i>push</i> insertion modes onto this stack, meaning
  that the specified insertion mode is to be added to the stack, and <i>pop</i> insertion modes from
  the stack, which means that the most recently added insertion mode must be removed from the
  stack.

  <hr />

  When the steps below require the user agent to <dfn>reset the insertion mode appropriately</dfn>, it
  means the user agent must follow these steps:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>last</var> be false.</li>

    <li>Let <var>node</var> be the last node in the <a>stack of open
    elements</a>.</li>

    <li><i>Loop</i>: If <var>node</var> is the first node in the stack of open elements,
    then set <var>last</var> to true, and, if the parser was originally created as part of
    the <a>HTML fragment parsing algorithm</a> (<a>fragment case</a>), set <var>node</var> to the
    <a>context</a>
    element passed to that algorithm.</li>

    <li>

    If <var>node</var> is a <{select}> element, run these substeps:

<h5 id="the-stack-of-open-elements">The stack of open elements</h5>

  Initially, the <dfn>stack of open elements</dfn> is empty. The stack grows downwards; the
  topmost node on the stack is the first one added to the stack, and the bottommost node of the
  stack is the most recently added node in the stack (notwithstanding when the stack is manipulated
  in a random access fashion as part of <a>the handling for misnested
  tags</a>).

  <p class="note">
    The "<a>before html</a>" <a>insertion mode</a> creates the <{html}> <a>document element</a>
    node, which is then added to the stack.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
  In the <a>fragment case</a>, the <a>stack of open elements</a> is
  initialized to contain an <{html}> element that is created as part of <a>that algorithm</a>. (The <a>fragment case</a> skips the
  "<a>before html</a>" <a>insertion mode</a>.)
  </p>

  The <code>html</code> node, however it is created, is the topmost node of the stack. It only
  gets popped off the stack when the parser <a>finishes</a>.

  The <dfn>current node</dfn> is the bottommost node in this <a>stack of open
  elements</a>.

  The <dfn>adjusted current node</dfn> is the <a>context</a>
  element if the parser was created by the <a>HTML fragment parsing algorithm</a> and the
  <a>stack of open elements</a> has only one element in it (<a>fragment case</a>);
  otherwise, the <a>adjusted current node</a> is the <a>current node</a>.

  Elements in the <a>stack of open elements</a> fall into the following categories:

  : <dfn>Special</dfn>

  <p class="note">
    Typically, the <a>special</a> elements have the start and and end tag tokens handled
    specifically, while <a>ordinary</a> elements' tokens fall into "any other start tag" and "any
    other end tag" clauses, and some parts of the tree builder check if a particular element in the
    <a>stack of open elements</a> is in the <a>special</a> category. However, some elements (e.g.,
    the <{option}> element) have their start or end tag tokens handled specifically, but are still
    not in the <a>special</a> category, so that they get the <a>ordinary</a> handling elsewhere.

  The <a>stack of open elements</a> is said to <dfn lt="as that element in the specific scope|have an element target node in a specific scope|has that element in the specific scope">have an element <var>target node</var> in a specific scope</dfn> consisting of a

  4. Otherwise, set <var>node</var> to the previous entry in the <a>stack of open elements</a> and
      return to step 2. (This will never fail, since the loop will always terminate in the previous
      step if the top of the stack &mdash; an <{html}> element &mdash; is reached.)

  The <a>stack of open elements</a> is said to <dfn lt="in scope">have a
  particular element in scope</dfn> when it <a>has
  that element in the specific scope</a> consisting of the following element types:

  <ul class="brief">

  <em>except</em> the following:

  </ul>

  Nothing happens if at any time any of the elements in the <a>stack of open elements</a>
  are moved to a new location in, or removed from, the <code>Document</code> tree. In particular,
  the stack is not changed in this situation. This can cause, amongst other strange effects, content
  to be appended to nodes that are no longer in the DOM.

  <p class="note">
    In some cases (namely, when <a>closing misnested formatting elements</a>), the stack is
    manipulated in a random-access fashion.
  </p>

<h5 id="the-list-of-active-formatting-elements">The list of active formatting elements</h5>

  Initially, the <dfn>list of active formatting elements</dfn> is empty. It is used to handle
  mis-nested <a>formatting element tags</a>.

  The list contains elements in the <a>formatting</a> category, and <a>markers</a>. The
  <dfn>markers</dfn> are inserted when entering <{applet}> elements, buttons, <{object}> elements,
  marquees, table cells, and table captions, and are used to prevent formatting from "leaking"
  <em>into</em> <{applet}> elements, buttons, <{object}> elements, marquees, and tables.

  In addition, each element in the <a>list of active formatting elements</a> is associated with the
  token for which it was created, so that further elements can be created for that token if
  necessary.

  When the steps below require the user agent to <dfn>push onto the list of active formatting elements</dfn>
  an element <var>element</var>,the user agent must perform the following steps:

  1. If there are already three elements in the <a>list of active formatting elements</a> after the
      last <a>marker</a>, if any, or anywhere in the list if there are no <a>markers</a>, that have
      the same tag name, namespace, and attributes as <var>element</var>, then remove the earliest
      such element from the <a>list of active formatting elements</a>. For these purposes, the
      attributes must be compared as they were when the elements were created by the parser; two
      elements have the same attributes if all their parsed attributes can be paired such that the
      two attributes in each pair have identical names, namespaces, and values (the order of the
      attributes does not matter).

      <p class="note">This is the Noah's Ark clause. But with three per family instead of two.</p>
  2. Add <var>element</var> to the <a>list of active formatting elements</a>.

  When the steps below require the user agent to <dfn for="elements" lt="reconstruct the active formatting element|reconstruct the active formatting elements|reconstruction of the active formatting element|reconstruction of the active formatting elements">reconstruct the active formatting elements</dfn>,
  the user agent must perform the following steps:

  1. If there are no entries in the <a>list of active formatting elements</a>, then there is nothing
      to reconstruct; stop this algorithm.
  2. If the last (most recently added) entry in the <a>list of active formatting elements</a> is a
      <a>marker</a>, or if it is an element that is in the <a>stack of open elements</a>, then there
      is nothing to reconstruct; stop this algorithm.
  3. Let <var>entry</var> be the last (most recently added) element in the
      <a>list of active formatting elements</a>.
  4. <i>Rewind</i>: If there are no entries before <var>entry</var> in the
      <a>list of active formatting elements</a>, then jump to the step labeled <i>create</i>.
  5. Let <var>entry</var> be the entry one earlier than <var>entry</var> in the
      <a>list of active formatting elements</a>.
  6. If <var>entry</var> is neither a <a>marker</a> nor an element that is also in the
      <a>stack of open elements</a>, go to the step labeled <i>rewind</i>.
  7. <i>Advance</i>: Let <var>entry</var> be the element one later than <var>entry</var> in the
      <a>list of active formatting elements</a>.
  8. <i>Create</i>: <a>Insert an HTML element</a> for the token for which the element
      <var>entry</var> was created, to obtain <var>new element</var>.
  9. Replace the entry for <var>entry</var> in the list with an entry for <var>new element</var>.
  10. If the entry for <var>new element</var> in the <a>list of active formatting elements</a> is
      not the last entry in the list, return to the step labeled <i>advance</i>.

  This has the effect of reopening all the formatting elements that were opened in the current
  body, cell, or caption (whichever is youngest) that haven't been explicitly closed.

  <p class="note">
    The way this specification is written, the <a>list of active formatting elements</a> always
    consists of elements in chronological order with the least recently added element first and the
    most recently added element last (except for while steps 7 to 10 of the above algorithm are
    being executed, of course).
  </p>

  When the steps below require the user agent to
  <dfn>clear the list of active formatting elements up to the last marker</dfn>, the user agent must
  perform the following steps:

  1. Let <var>entry</var> be the last (most recently added) entry in the
      <a>list of active formatting elements</a>.
  2. Remove <var>entry</var> from the <a>list of active formatting elements</a>.
  3. If <var>entry</var> was a <a>marker</a>, then stop the algorithm at this point. The list has
      been cleared up to the last <a>marker</a>.
  4. Go to step 1.

<h5 id="the-element-pointers">The element pointers</h5>

  Initially, the <dfn><code>head</code> element pointer</dfn> and the
  <dfn><code>form</code> element pointer</dfn> are both null.

  Once a <{head}> element has been parsed (whether implicitly or explicitly) the
  <a><code>head</code> element pointer</a> gets set to point to this node.

  The <a><code>form</code> element pointer</a> points to the last
  <{form}> element that was opened and whose end tag has not yet been seen. It is used to
  make form controls associate with forms in the face of dramatically bad markup, for historical
  reasons. It is ignored inside <{template}> elements.

<h5 id="other-parsing-state-flags">Other parsing state flags</h5>

  The <dfn lt="scripting flag|scripting was enabled or not">scripting flag</dfn> is set to "enabled" if <a>scripting
  was enabled</a> for the <code>Document</code> with which the parser is associated when the
  parser was created, and "disabled" otherwise.

  <p class="note">
  The <a>scripting flag</a> can be enabled even when the parser was originally
  created for the <a>HTML fragment parsing algorithm</a>, even though <code>script</code>
  elements don't execute in that case.
  </p>

  The <dfn>frameset-ok flag</dfn> is set to "ok" when the parser is created. It is set to "not
  ok" after certain tokens are seen.

  </div>

  <div class="impl">

<h4 id="sec-tokenization"><dfn lt="tokenizer|tokenization">Tokenization</dfn></h4>

  Implementations must act as if they used the following state machine to tokenize HTML. The
  state machine must start in the [[#data-state]]. Most states consume a single character,
  which may have various side-effects, and either switches the state machine to a new state to
  <i>reconsume</i> the same character, or switches it to a new state to consume the next character,
  or stays in the same state to consume the next character. Some states have more complicated
  behavior and can consume several characters before switching to another state. In some cases, the
  tokenizer state is also changed by the tree construction stage.

  The exact behavior of certain states depends on the <a>insertion mode</a> and the
  <a>stack of open elements</a>. Certain states also use a <dfn><var>temporary buffer</var></dfn> to track progress.

  The output of the tokenization step is a series of zero or more of the following tokens:
  DOCTYPE, start tag, end tag, comment, character, end-of-file. DOCTYPE tokens have a name, a public
  identifier, a system identifier, and a <dfn><i>force-quirks flag</i></dfn>. When a DOCTYPE token
  is created, its name, public identifier, and system identifier must be marked as missing (which is
  a distinct state from the empty string), and the <i>force-quirks flag</i> must be set to
  <i>off</i> (its other state is <i>on</i>). Start and end tag tokens have a tag name, a <dfn>self-closing flag</dfn>, and a list of attributes, each of which has a
  name and a value. When a start or end tag token is created, its <i>self-closing flag</i> must be unset (its other state is that it be set), and its attributes
  list must be empty. Comment and character tokens have data.

  When a token is emitted, it must immediately be handled by the tree construction
  stage. The tree construction stage can affect the state of the tokenization stage, and can insert
  additional characters into the stream. (For example, the <{script}> element can result in
  scripts executing and using the <a>dynamic markup insertion</a> APIs to insert characters
  into the stream being tokenized.)

  <p class="note">
  Creating a token and emitting it are distinct actions. It is possible for a token
  to be created but implicitly abandoned (never emitted), e.g., if the file ends unexpectedly while
  processing the characters that are being parsed into a start tag token.
  </p>

  When a start tag token is emitted with its <i>self-closing flag</i> set, if the flag is not
  <dfn lt="acknowledge the token's self-closing flag|acknowledged">acknowledged</dfn> when it is processed by the tree
  construction stage, that is a <a for="parser">parse error</a>.

  When an end tag token is emitted with attributes, that is a <a for="parser">parse error</a>.

  When an end tag token is emitted with its <i>self-closing flag</i> set, that is a <a for="parser">parse error</a>.

  An <dfn>appropriate end tag token</dfn> is an end tag token whose tag name matches the tag name
  of the last start tag to have been emitted from this tokenizer, if any. If no start tag has been
  emitted from this tokenizer, then no end tag token is appropriate.

  Before each step of the tokenizer, the user agent must first check the <a>parser pause
  flag</a>. If it is true, then the tokenizer must abort the processing of any nested invocations
  of the tokenizer, yielding control back to the caller.

  The tokenizer state machine consists of the states defined in the following subsections.

  When the user agent leaves the attribute name state (and before emitting the tag token, if
  appropriate), the complete attribute's name must be compared to the other attributes on the same
  token; if there is already an attribute on the token with the exact same name, then this is a
  <a for="parser">parse error</a> and the new attribute must be removed from the token.

  <p class="note">
  If an attribute is so removed from a token, it, and the value that gets associated
  with it, if any, are never subsequently used by the parser, and are therefore effectively
  discarded. Removing the attribute in this way does not change its status as the "current
  attribute" for the purposes of the tokenizer, however.

<h5 id="tokenizing-character-references">Tokenizing character references</h5>

  This section defines how to <dfn>consume a character reference</dfn>, optionally with an
  <dfn>additional allowed character</dfn>, which, if specified where the algorithm is invoked, adds
  a character to the list of characters that cause there to not be a character reference.

  This definition is used when parsing character references in text and in attributes.

  The behavior depends on the identity of the next character (the one immediately after the
  U+0026 AMPERSAND character), as follows:

  <dl class="switch">

    <dt>U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab)</dt>
    <dt>U+000A LINE FEED (LF)</dt>
    <dt>U+000C FORM FEED (FF)</dt>

    <dt>U+0020 SPACE</dt>
    <dt>U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN</dt>
    <dt>U+0026 AMPERSAND</dt>
    <dt>EOF</dt>
    <dt>The <a>additional allowed character</a>, if there is one</dt>

    <dd>Not a character reference. No characters are consumed, and nothing is returned. (This is not
    an error, either.)</dd>

    <dt>U+0023 NUMBER SIGN (#)</dt>

    <dd>

    Consume the U+0023 NUMBER SIGN.

    The behavior further depends on the character after the U+0023 NUMBER SIGN:

    <dl class="switch">

      <dt>U+0078 LATIN SMALL LETTER X</dt>
      <dt>U+0058 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER X</dt>

      <dd>

      Consume the X.

      Follow the steps below, but using <a>ASCII hex digits</a>.

      When it comes to interpreting the number, interpret it as a hexadecimal number.

      </dd>

      <dt>Anything else</dt>

      <dd>

      Follow the steps below, but using <a>ASCII digits</a>.

      When it comes to interpreting the number, interpret it as a decimal number.

      </dd>

    </dl>

    Consume as many characters as match the range of characters given above (<a>ASCII hex digits</a>
    or <a>ASCII digits</a>).

    If no characters match the range, then don't consume any characters (and unconsume the U+0023
    NUMBER SIGN character and, if appropriate, the X character). This is a <a for="parser">parse error</a>;
    nothing is returned.

    Otherwise, if the next character is a U+003B SEMICOLON, consume that too. If it isn't, there
    is a <a for="parser">parse error</a>.

    If one or more characters match the range, then take them all and interpret the string of
    characters as a number (either hexadecimal or decimal as appropriate).

    If that number is one of the numbers in the first column of the following table, then this is
    a <a for="parser">parse error</a>. Find the row with that number in the first column, and return a
    character token for the Unicode character given in the second column of that row.

    If no match can be made, then no characters are consumed, and nothing is returned. In this

    (&amp;) must be unconsumed, and nothing is returned.

    However, if this next character is in fact a U+003D EQUALS SIGN character (=), then this is a

    misinterpret the markup in those cases.

    Otherwise, a character reference is parsed. If the last character matched is not a U+003B

<h4 id="tree-construction">Tree construction</h4>

  The input to the tree construction stage is a sequence of tokens from the
  <a>tokenization</a> stage. The tree construction stage is associated with a DOM
  <code>Document</code> object when a parser is created. The "output" of this stage consists of
  dynamically modifying or extending that document's DOM tree.

  This specification does not define when an interactive user agent has to render the
  <code>Document</code> so that it is available to the user, or when it has to begin accepting user
  input.

  <hr />

  As each token is emitted from the tokenizer, the user agent must follow the appropriate steps
  from the following list, known as the <dfn>tree construction dispatcher</dfn>:

  <dl class="switch">

    <dt>If the <a>adjusted current node</a> is a <a>MathML text integration point</a> and the token is a character token</dt>
    <dt>If the <a>adjusted current node</a> is an <a>MathML <code>annotation-xml</code></a> element and the token is a start tag whose tag name is "svg"</dt>
    <dt>If the <a>adjusted current node</a> is an <a>HTML integration point</a> and the token is a start tag</dt>
    <dt>If the <a>adjusted current node</a> is an <a>HTML integration point</a> and the token is a character token</dt>
    <dt>If the token is an end-of-file token</dt>

  The <dfn>next token</dfn> is the token that is about to be processed by the <a>tree
  construction dispatcher</a> (even if the token is subsequently just ignored).

  A node is a <dfn>MathML text integration point</dfn> if it is one of the following
  elements:

  <ul class="brief">
    <li>An <a>MathML <code>mi</code></a> element</li>
    <li>An <a>MathML <code>mo</code></a> element</li>

    <li>An <a>MathML <code>ms</code></a> element</li>
    <li>An <a>MathML <code>mtext</code></a> element</li>
  </ul>

  A node is an <dfn>HTML integration point</dfn> if it is one of the following elements:

  <ul class="brief">
    <li>An <a>MathML <code>annotation-xml</code></a> element in the <a>MathML namespace</a> whose
    start tag token had an attribute with the name "encoding" whose value was

  </ul>

  <p class="note">
  If the node in question is the <a>context</a> element passed to the <a>HTML fragment

  </p>

  <p class="note">
  Not all of the tag names mentioned below are conformant tag names in this

  The algorithm described below places no limit on the depth of the DOM tree

  When the steps below require the user agent to <dfn lt="create an element for the token|create an element for a token">create an element for a token</dfn> in a particular <var>given namespace</var> and with a
  particular <var>intended parent</var>, the user agent must run the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>

    Create a node implementing the interface appropriate for the element type corresponding to
    the tag name of the token in <var>given namespace</var> (as given in the specification
    that defines that element, e.g., for an <{a}> element in the <a>HTML
    namespace</a>, this specification defines it to be the <code>HTMLAnchorElement</code>
    interface), with the tag name being the name of that element, with the node being in the given
    namespace, and with the attributes on the node being those given in the given token.

    The interface appropriate for an element in the <a>HTML namespace</a> that is not
    defined in this specification (or <a lt="applicable specification">other applicable specifications</a>) is
    {{HTMLUnknownElement}}. Elements in other namespaces whose interface is not defined by
    that namespace's specification must use the interface {{Element}}.

    The <a>node document</a> of the newly created element
    must be the <a>node document</a> of the <var>intended parent</var>.

    </li>

    <li>If the newly created element has an <code>xmlns</code> attribute <em>in the
    <a>XMLNS namespace</a></em> whose value is not exactly the same as the element's namespace,
    that is a <a for="parser">parse error</a>. Similarly, if the newly created element has an <code>xmlns:xlink</code> attribute in the <a>XMLNS namespace</a> whose value is not the
    <a>XLink namespace</a>, that is a <a for="parser">parse error</a>.</li>

    <li>If the newly created element is a <a>resettable element</a>,
    invoke its <a>reset algorithm</a>. (This initializes the
    element's <a for="forms">value</a> and <a for="forms">checkedness</a> based on the element's attributes.)</li>

    <li>If the element is a <a>form-associated element</a>, and the <a><code>form</code> element pointer</a> is not null, and there is no <code>template</code>
    element on the <a>stack of open elements</a>, and the newly created element is either not
    <a>reassociateable</a> or doesn't have a <code>form</code> attribute, and the <var>intended parent</var> is in
    the same <a>tree</a> as the element pointed to by the <a><code>form</code> element pointer</a>, associate the newly created element with the
    <{form}> element pointed to by the <a><code>form</code> element
    pointer</a>, and suppress the running of the <a>reset the form owner</a> algorithm when
    the parser subsequently attempts to insert the element.</li>

    <li>Return the newly created element.</li>

  </ol>

  <hr />

  When the steps below require the user agent to <dfn>insert a foreign element</dfn> for a token
  in a given namespace, the user agent must run these steps:

  <ol>

    <li>Let the <var>adjusted insertion location</var> be the <a>appropriate place for
    inserting a node</a>.</li>

    <li><a>Create an element for the token</a> in the given namespace, with the intended
    parent being the element in which the <var>adjusted insertion location</var> finds
    itself.</li>

    <li>

    If it is possible to insert an element at the <var>adjusted insertion
    location</var>, then insert the newly created element at the <var>adjusted insertion
    location</var>.

    <p class="note">
  If the <var>adjusted insertion location</var> cannot accept more
    elements, e.g., because it's a <code>Document</code> that already has an element child, then the
    newly created element is dropped on the floor.
  </p>

    </li>

    <li>Push the element onto the <a>stack of open elements</a> so that it is the new
    <a>current node</a>.</li>

    <li>Return the newly created element.</li>

  </ol>

  When the steps below require the user agent to <dfn>insert an HTML element</dfn> for a token,
  the user agent must <a>insert a foreign element</a> for the token, in the <a>HTML
  namespace</a>.

  <hr />

  When the steps below require the user agent to <dfn>adjust MathML attributes</dfn> for a token,
  then, if the token has an attribute named <code>definitionurl</code>, change its name to
  <code>definitionURL</code> (note the case difference).

  When the steps below require the user agent to <dfn>adjust SVG attributes</dfn> for a token,
  then, for each attribute on the token whose attribute name is one of the ones in the first column
  of the following table, change the attribute's name to the name given in the corresponding cell in
  the second column. (This fixes the case of SVG attributes that are not all lowercase.)

  When the steps below require the user agent to <dfn>insert a comment</dfn> while processing a
  comment token, optionally with an explicitly insertion position <var>position</var>, the
  user agent must run the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>data</var> be the data given in the comment token being
    processed.</li>

    <li>If <var>position</var> was specified, then let the <var>adjusted
    insertion location</var> be <var>position</var>. Otherwise, let <var>adjusted
    insertion location</var> be the <a>appropriate place for inserting a node</a>.</li>

    <li>Create a <code>Comment</code> node whose <code>data</code> attribute is set to
    <var>data</var> and whose <a>node document</a> is
    the same as that of the node in which the <var>adjusted insertion location</var> finds
    itself.

    <li>Insert the newly created node at the <var>adjusted insertion
    location</var>.</li>

  </ol>

  <hr />

  DOM mutation events must not fire for changes caused by the user agent
  parsing the document. This includes the parsing of any content inserted using <a method lt="write()"><code>document.write()</code></a> and <code>document.writeln()</code> calls. [[!UIEVENTS]]

  However, <a>mutation observers</a> <em>do</em> fire, as required by the DOM specification.

<h5 id="parsing-elements-that-contain-only-text">Parsing elements that contain only text</h5>

  The <dfn>generic raw text element parsing algorithm</dfn> and the <dfn>generic RCDATA element
  parsing algorithm</dfn> consist of the following steps. These algorithms are always invoked in
  response to a start tag token.

  <ol>

    <li><a>Insert an HTML element</a> for the token.</li>

    <li>If the algorithm that was invoked is the <a>generic raw text element parsing
    algorithm</a>, switch the tokenizer to the [[#rawtext-state]]; otherwise the algorithm
    invoked was the <a>generic RCDATA element parsing algorithm</a>, switch the tokenizer to
    the [[#rcdata-state]].</li>

    <li>Let the <a>original insertion mode</a> be the current <a>insertion

  pop the <a>current node</a> off the <a>stack of open

  If a step requires the user agent to generate implied end tags but lists
  an element to exclude from the process, then the user agent must perform the
  above steps as if that element was not in the above list.

  When the steps below require the user agent to <dfn>generate all implied end tags thoroughly</dfn>,
  then, while the <a>current node</a> is a <{caption}> element, a

<h6 id="the-initial-insertion-mode">The "<dfn>initial</dfn>" insertion mode</h6>

  When the user agent is to apply the rules for the "<a>initial</a>" <a>insertion mode</a>, the user agent must handle the token as
  follows:

  <dl class="switch">

    <dt>A character token that is one of U+0009 CHARACTER
    TABULATION, U+000A LINE FEED (LF), U+000C FORM FEED (FF),
    U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR), or U+0020 SPACE</dt>
    <dd>
    Ignore the token.
    </dd>

    <dt>A comment token</dt>
    <dd>
    <a>Insert a comment</a> as the last child of the <code>Document</code> object.
    </dd>

    <dt>A DOCTYPE token</dt>
    <dd>

    If the DOCTYPE token's name is not a <a>case-sensitive</a> match for the string "<code>html</code>", or the token's public identifier is not missing, or the token's system
    identifier is neither missing nor a <a>case-sensitive</a> match for the string
    "<a scheme><code>about:legacy-compat</code></a>", and none of the sets of conditions in the following list are
    matched, then there is a <a for="parser">parse error</a>.

    <ul>

      <li>The DOCTYPE token's name is a <a>case-sensitive</a> match for the string "<code>html</code>", the token's public identifier is the <a>case-sensitive</a> string
      "<code>-//W3C//DTD&nbsp;HTML&nbsp;4.0//EN</code>", and the token's system identifier
      is either missing or the <a>case-sensitive</a> string "<code>http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/strict.dtd</code>".</li>

      <li>The DOCTYPE token's name is a <a>case-sensitive</a> match for the string "<code>html</code>", the token's public identifier is the <a>case-sensitive</a> string
      "<code>-//W3C//DTD&nbsp;HTML&nbsp;4.01//EN</code>", and the token's system identifier
      is either missing or the <a>case-sensitive</a> string "<code>http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd</code>".</li>

      <li>The DOCTYPE token's name is a <a>case-sensitive</a> match for the string "<code>html</code>", the token's public identifier is the <a>case-sensitive</a> string
      "<code>-//W3C//DTD&nbsp;XHTML&nbsp;1.0&nbsp;Strict//EN</code>", and the token's system
      identifier is the <a>case-sensitive</a> string "<code>http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd</code>".</li>

      <li>The DOCTYPE token's name is a <a>case-sensitive</a> match for the string "<code>html</code>", the token's public identifier is the <a>case-sensitive</a> string
      "<code>-//W3C//DTD&nbsp;XHTML&nbsp;1.1//EN</code>", and the token's system identifier
      is the <a>case-sensitive</a> string "<code>http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd</code>".</li>

    </ul>

    Conformance checkers may, based on the values (including presence or lack thereof) of the
    DOCTYPE token's name, public identifier, or system identifier, switch to a conformance checking
    mode for another language (e.g., based on the DOCTYPE token a conformance checker could recognize
    that the document is an HTML 4.01-era document, and defer to an HTML 4.01 conformance checker.)

    Append a <code>DocumentType</code> node to the <code>Document</code> node, with the <code>name</code> attribute set to the name given in the DOCTYPE token, or the empty string
    if the name was missing; the <code>publicId</code> attribute set to the public
    identifier given in the DOCTYPE token, or the empty string if the public identifier was missing;
    the <code>systemId</code> attribute set to the system identifier given in the DOCTYPE
    token, or the empty string if the system identifier was missing; and the other attributes
    specific to <code>DocumentType</code> objects set to null and empty lists as appropriate.
    Associate the <code>DocumentType</code> node with the <code>Document</code> object so that it is
    returned as the value of the <code>doctype</code> attribute of the
    <code>Document</code> object.

    Then, if the document is <em>not</em> <a lt="iframe srcdoc document">an <code>iframe</code>
    <code>srcdoc</code> document</a>, and the DOCTYPE token matches
    one of the conditions in the following list, then set the <code>Document</code> to <a>quirks

<h4 id="coercing-an-html-dom-into-an-infoset">Coercing an HTML DOM into an infoset</h4>

  When an application uses an <a>HTML parser</a> in conjunction with an XML pipeline, it is
  possible that the constructed DOM is not compatible with the XML tool chain in certain subtle
  ways. For example, an XML toolchain might not be able to represent attributes with the name <code>xmlns</code>, since they conflict with the Namespaces in XML syntax. There is also some
  data that the <a>HTML parser</a> generates that isn't included in the DOM itself. This
  section specifies some rules for handling these issues.

  If the XML API being used doesn't support DOCTYPEs, the tool may drop DOCTYPEs altogether.

  If the XML API doesn't support attributes in no namespace that are named "<code>xmlns</code>", attributes whose names start with "<code>xmlns:</code>", or
  attributes in the <a>XMLNS namespace</a>, then the tool may drop such attributes.

  The tool may annotate the output with any namespace declarations required for proper
  operation.

  If the XML API being used restricts the allowable characters in the local names of elements and
  attributes, then the tool may map all element and attribute local names that the API wouldn't
  support to a set of names that <em>are</em> allowed, by replacing any character that isn't
  supported with the uppercase letter U and the six digits of the character's Unicode code point
  when expressed in hexadecimal, using digits 0-9 and capital letters A-F as the symbols, in
  increasing numeric order.

  <p class="example">
  For example, the element name <code>foo&lt;bar</code>, which can be
  output by the <a>HTML parser</a>, though it is neither a legal HTML element name nor a
  well-formed XML element name, would be converted into <code>fooU00003Cbar</code>, which
  <em>is</em> a well-formed XML element name (though it's still not legal in HTML by any means).
  </p>

  <p class="example">
  As another example, consider the attribute <code>xlink:href</code>.
  Used on a MathML element, it becomes, after being <a lt="adjust foreign attributes">adjusted</a>, an attribute with a prefix "<code>xlink</code>" and a local
  name "<code>href</code>". However, used on an HTML element, it becomes an attribute with
  no prefix and the local name "<code>xlink:href</code>", which is not a valid NCName, and
  thus might not be accepted by an XML API. It could thus get converted, becoming "<code>xlinkU00003Ahref</code>".
  </p>

  <p class="note">
  The resulting names from this conversion conveniently can't clash with any
  attribute generated by the <a>HTML parser</a>, since those are all either lowercase or those

  If the XML API restricts comments from having two consecutive U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS characters
  (--), the tool may insert a single U+0020 SPACE character between any such offending
  characters.

  If the XML API restricts comments from ending in a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS character (-), the tool
  may insert a single U+0020 SPACE character at the end of such comments.

  If the XML API restricts allowed characters in character data, attribute values, or comments,
  the tool may replace any U+000C FORM FEED (FF) character with a U+0020 SPACE character, and any
  other literal non-XML character with a U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER.

  If the tool has no way to convey out-of-band information, then the tool may drop the following
  information:

  <ul>

    <li>Whether the document is set to <i>no-quirks mode</i>, <i>limited-quirks mode</i>, or
    <i>quirks mode</i></li>

    <li>The association between form controls and forms that aren't their nearest <code>form</code>
    element ancestor (use of the <a><code>form</code> element pointer</a> in the parser)</li>

    <li>The <a>template contents</a> of any <{template}> elements.</li>

<h4 id="an-introduction-to-error-handling-and-strange-cases-in-the-parser">An introduction to error handling and strange cases in the parser</h4>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  This section examines some erroneous markup and discusses how the <a>HTML parser</a>
  handles these cases.

<h5 id="misnested-tags-b-i-b-i">Misnested tags: &lt;b>&lt;i>&lt;/b>&lt;/i></h5>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  The most-often discussed example of erroneous markup is as follows:

  <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;p>1&lt;b>2&lt;i>3&lt;/b>4&lt;/i>5&lt;/p>
  </pre>

  The parsing of this markup is straightforward up to the "3". At this point, the DOM looks like
  this:

  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t1"><{html}><ul><li class="t1"><{head}></li><li class="t1"><{body}><ul><li class="t1"><{p}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>1</span></li><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <a>2</a></li><li class="t1"><{i}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>3</span></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

  Here, the <a>stack of open elements</a> has five elements on it: <{html}>,
  <{body}>, <{p}>, <{b}>, and <{i}>. The <a>list of active
  formatting elements</a> just has two: <{b}> and <{i}>. The <a>insertion
  mode</a> is "<a>in body</a>".

  Upon receiving the end tag token with the tag name "b", the "<a>adoption
  agency algorithm</a>" is invoked. This is a simple case, in that the <var>formatting
  element</var> is the <{b}> element, and there is no <var>furthest block</var>.
  Thus, the <a>stack of open elements</a> ends up with just three elements: <{html}>,
  <{body}>, and <{p}>, while the <a>list of active formatting elements</a>
  has just one: <{i}>. The DOM tree is unmodified at this point.

  The next token is a character ("4"), triggers the <a>reconstruction of the active formatting elements</a>, in this case just
  the <{i}> element. A new <{i}> element is thus created for the "4"
  <code>Text</code> node. After the end tag token for the "i" is also received, and the "5"
  <code>Text</code> node is inserted, the DOM looks as follows:

  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t1"><{html}><ul><li class="t1"><{head}></li><li class="t1"><{body}><ul><li class="t1"><{p}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>1</span></li><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <a>2</a></li><li class="t1"><{i}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>3</span></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="t1"><{i}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>4</span></li></ul></li><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>5</span></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<h5 id="misnested-tags-b-p-b-p">Misnested tags: &lt;b>&lt;p>&lt;/b>&lt;/p></h5>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  A case similar to the previous one is the following:

  <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;b>1&lt;p>2&lt;/b>3&lt;/p>
  </pre>

  Up to the "2" the parsing here is straightforward:

  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t1"><{html}><ul><li class="t1"><{head}></li><li class="t1"><{body}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>1</span></li><li class="t1"><{p}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <a>2</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

  The interesting part is when the end tag token with the tag name "b" is parsed.

  Before that token is seen, the <a>stack of open elements</a> has four elements on it:
  <{html}>, <{body}>, <{b}>, and <{p}>. The <a>list of active
  formatting elements</a> just has the one: <{b}>. The <a>insertion mode</a> is
  "<a>in body</a>".

  Upon receiving the end tag token with the tag name "b", the "<a>adoption
  agency algorithm</a>" is invoked, as in the previous example. However, in this case, there
  <em>is</em> a <var>furthest block</var>, namely the <{p}> element. Thus, this
  time the adoption agency algorithm isn't skipped over.

  The <var>common ancestor</var> is the <{body}> element. A conceptual
  "bookmark" marks the position of the <code>b</code> in the <a>list of active formatting
  elements</a>, but since that list has only one element in it, the bookmark won't have much
  effect.

  As the algorithm progresses, <var>node</var> ends up set to the formatting element
  (<code>b</code>), and <var>last node</var> ends up set to the <var>furthest
  block</var> (<code>p</code>).

  The <var>last node</var> gets appended (moved) to the <var>common
  ancestor</var>, so that the DOM looks like:

  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t1"><{html}><ul><li class="t1"><{head}></li><li class="t1"><{body}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>1</span></li></ul></li><li class="t1"><{p}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <a>2</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

  A new <{b}> element is created, and the children of the <{p}> element are
  moved to it:

  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t1"><{html}><ul><li class="t1"><{head}></li><li class="t1"><{body}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>1</span></li></ul></li><li class="t1"><{p}></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>
  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <a>2</a></li></ul></li></ul>

  Finally, the new <{b}> element is appended to the <{p}> element, so that the
  DOM looks like:

  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t1"><{html}><ul><li class="t1"><{head}></li><li class="t1"><{body}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>1</span></li></ul></li><li class="t1"><{p}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <a>2</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

  The <{b}> element is removed from the <a>list of active formatting elements</a>
  and the <a>stack of open elements</a>, so that when the "3" is parsed, it is appended to the
  <{p}> element:

  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t1"><{html}><ul><li class="t1"><{head}></li><li class="t1"><{body}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>1</span></li></ul></li><li class="t1"><{p}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <a>2</a></li></ul></li><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>3</span></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<h5 id="unexpected-markup-in-tables">Unexpected markup in tables</h5>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  Error handling in tables is, for historical reasons, especially strange. For example, consider
  the following markup:

  <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;table>&lt;b>&lt;tr>&lt;td>aaa&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>bbb&lt;/table>ccc
  </pre>

  The highlighted <{b}> element start tag is not allowed directly inside a table like
  that, and the parser handles this case by placing the element <em>before</em> the table. (This is
  called <i>foster parenting</i>.) This can be seen by examining the DOM tree
  as it stands just after the <{table}> element's start tag has been seen:

  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t1"><{html}><ul><li class="t1"><{head}></li><li class="t1"><{body}><ul><li class="t1"><{table}></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

  ...and then immediately after the <{b}> element start tag has been seen:

  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t1"><{html}><ul><li class="t1"><{head}></li><li class="t1"><{body}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}></li><li class="t1"><{table}></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

  At this point, the <a>stack of open elements</a> has on it the elements
  <{html}>, <{body}>, <{table}>, and <code>b</code> (in that order,
  despite the resulting DOM tree); the <a>list of active formatting elements</a> just has the
  <{b}> element in it; and the <a>insertion mode</a> is "<a>in table</a>".

  The <code>tr</code> start tag causes the <{b}> element to be popped off the stack and
  a <code>tbody</code> start tag to be implied; the <code>tbody</code> and <{tr}> elements
  are then handled in a rather straight-forward manner, taking the parser through the "<a>in table body</a>" and "<a>in row</a>" insertion modes, after which the DOM looks as follows:

  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t1"><{html}><ul><li class="t1"><{head}></li><li class="t1"><{body}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}></li><li class="t1"><{table}><ul><li class="t1"><{tbody}><ul><li class="t1"><{tr}></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

  Here, the <a>stack of open elements</a> has on it the elements <{html}>,
  <{body}>, <{table}>, <{tbody}>, and <code>tr</code>; the <a>list of
  active formatting elements</a> still has the <{b}> element in it; and the
  <a>insertion mode</a> is "<a>in row</a>".

  The <{td}> element start tag token, after putting a <{td}> element on the
  tree, puts a <a>marker</a> on the <a>list of active
  formatting elements</a> (it also switches to the "<a>in
  cell</a>" <a>insertion mode</a>).

  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t1"><{html}><ul><li class="t1"><{head}></li><li class="t1"><{body}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}></li><li class="t1"><{table}><ul><li class="t1"><{tbody}><ul><li class="t1"><{tr}><ul><li class="t1"><{td}></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

  The <a>marker</a> means that when the "aaa" character
  tokens are seen, no <{b}> element is created to hold the resulting <code>Text</code>
  node:

  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t1"><{html}><ul><li class="t1"><{head}></li><li class="t1"><{body}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}></li><li class="t1"><{table}><ul><li class="t1"><{tbody}><ul><li class="t1"><{tr}><ul><li class="t1"><{td}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>aaa</span></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

  The end tags are handled in a straight-forward manner; after handling them, the <a>stack of
  open elements</a> has on it the elements <{html}>, <{body}>,
  <{table}>, and <code>tbody</code>; the <a>list of active formatting elements</a>
  still has the <{b}> element in it (the <a>marker</a>
  having been removed by the "td" end tag token); and the <a>insertion mode</a> is "<a>in table body</a>".

  Thus it is that the "bbb" character tokens are found. These trigger the "<a>in table text</a>" insertion mode to be used (with the <a>original
  insertion mode</a> set to "<a>in table body</a>").
  The character tokens are collected, and when the next token (the <{table}> element end
  tag) is seen, they are processed as a group. Since they are not all spaces, they are handled as
  per the "anything else" rules in the "<a>in table</a>"
  insertion mode, which defer to the "<a>in body</a>"
  insertion mode but with <a>foster parenting</a>.

  When <a lt="reconstruct the active formatting elements">the active formatting elements
  are reconstructed</a>, a <{b}> element is created and <a>foster parented</a>, and then the "bbb" <code>Text</code> node is appended to it:

  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t1"><{html}><ul><li class="t1"><{head}></li><li class="t1"><{body}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}></li><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>bbb</span></li></ul></li><li class="t1"><{table}><ul><li class="t1"><{tbody}><ul><li class="t1"><{tr}><ul><li class="t1"><{td}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>aaa</span></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

  The <a>stack of open elements</a> has on it the elements <{html}>,
  <{body}>, <{table}>, <{tbody}>, and the new <code>b</code> (again, note
  that this doesn't match the resulting tree!); the <a>list of active formatting elements</a>
  has the new <{b}> element in it; and the <a>insertion mode</a> is still "<a>in table body</a>".

  Had the character tokens been only <a>space characters</a>
  instead of "bbb", then those <a>space characters</a> would just be
  appended to the <{tbody}> element.

  Finally, the <code>table</code> is closed by a "table" end tag. This pops all the nodes from
  the <a>stack of open elements</a> up to and including the <{table}> element, but it
  doesn't affect the <a>list of active formatting elements</a>, so the "ccc" character tokens
  after the table result in yet another <{b}> element being created, this time after the
  table:

  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t1"><{html}><ul><li class="t1"><{head}></li><li class="t1"><{body}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}></li><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>bbb</span></li></ul></li><li class="t1"><{table}><ul><li class="t1"><{tbody}><ul><li class="t1"><{tr}><ul><li class="t1"><{td}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>aaa</span></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: ccc</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<h5 id="scripts-that-modify-the-page-as-it-is-being-parsed">Scripts that modify the page as it is being parsed</h5>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  Consider the following markup, which for this example we will assume is the document with
  <a for="url">URL</a> <code>https://example.com/inner</code>, being rendered as the content of
  an <code>iframe</code> in another document with the <a for="url">URL</a> <code>https://example.com/outer</code>:

  <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;div id=a>
  &lt;script>
  var div = document.getElementById("a");
  parent.document.body.appendChild(div);
  &lt;/script>
  &lt;script>
  alert(document.URL);
  &lt;/script>
  &lt;/div>
  &lt;script>
  alert(document.URL);
  &lt;/script>
  </pre>

  Up to the first "script" end tag, before the script is parsed, the result is relatively
  straightforward:

  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t1"><{html}><ul><li class="t1"><{head}></li><li class="t1"><{body}><ul><li class="t1"><{div}> <span class="t2"><code class="attribute name">id</code>="<code class="attribute value">a</code>"</span><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: </li><li class="t1"><{script}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: var div = document.getElementById("a"); &#x23CE; parent.document.body.appendChild(div);</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

  After the script is parsed, though, the <{div}> element and its child
  <{script}> element are gone:

  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t1"><{html}><ul><li class="t1"><{head}></li><li class="t1"><{body}></li></ul></li></ul>

  They are, at this point, in the <code>Document</code> of the aforementioned outer
  <a>browsing context</a>. However, the <a>stack of open elements</a> <em>still contains
  the <{div}> element</em>.

  Thus, when the second <{script}> element is parsed, it is inserted <em>into the outer
  <code>Document</code> object</em>.

  Those parsed into different <code>Document</code>s than the one the parser was created for do
  not execute, so the first alert does not show.

  Once the <{div}> element's end tag is parsed, the <{div}> element is popped
  off the stack, and so the next <{script}> element is in the inner
  <code>Document</code>:

  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t1"><{html}><ul><li class="t1"><{head}></li><li class="t1"><{body}><ul><li class="t1"><{script}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: alert(document.URL);</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

  This script does execute, resulting in an alert that says "https://example.com/inner".

<h5 id="the-execution-of-scripts-that-are-moving-across-multiple-documents">The execution of scripts that are moving across multiple documents</h5>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  Elaborating on the example in the previous section, consider the case where the second
  <{script}> element is an external script (i.e., one with a <code>src</code> attribute). Since the element was not in the parser's
  <code>Document</code> when it was created, that external script is not even downloaded.

  In a case where a <{script}> element with a <code>src</code>
  attribute is parsed normally into its parser's {{Document}}, but while the external
  script is being downloaded, the element is moved to another document, the script continues to
  download, but does not execute.

  <p class="note">
  In general, moving <{script}> elements between <code>Document</code>s is
  considered a bad practice.
  </p>

<h5 id="unclosed-formatting-elements">Unclosed formatting elements</h5>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  The following markup shows how nested formatting elements (such as <code>b</code>) get
  collected and continue to be applied even as the elements they are contained in are closed, but
  that excessive duplicates are thrown away.

  <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;!DOCTYPE html>
  &lt;p>&lt;b class=x>&lt;b class=x>&lt;b>&lt;b class=x>&lt;b class=x>&lt;b>X
  &lt;p>X
  &lt;p>&lt;b>&lt;b class=x>&lt;b>X
  &lt;p>&lt;/b>&lt;/b>&lt;/b>&lt;/b>&lt;/b>&lt;/b>X
  </pre>

  The resulting DOM tree is as follows:

  <ul class="domTree"><li class="t10">DOCTYPE: <code>html</code></li><li class="t1"><{html}><ul><li class="t1"><{head}></li><li class="t1"><{body}><ul><li class="t1"><{p}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}> <span class="t2"><code class="attribute name">class</code>="<code class="attribute value">x</code>"</span><ul><li class="t1"><{b}> <span class="t2"><code class="attribute name">class</code>="<code class="attribute value">x</code>"</span><ul><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}> <span class="t2"><code class="attribute name">class</code>="<code class="attribute value">x</code>"</span><ul><li class="t1"><{b}> <span class="t2"><code class="attribute name">class</code>="<code class="attribute value">x</code>"</span><ul><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: X&#x23CE;</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="t1"><{p}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}> <span class="t2"><code class="attribute name">class</code>="<code class="attribute value">x</code>"</span><ul><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}> <span class="t2"><code class="attribute name">class</code>="<code class="attribute value">x</code>"</span><ul><li class="t1"><{b}> <span class="t2"><code class="attribute name">class</code>="<code class="attribute value">x</code>"</span><ul><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: X&#x23CE;</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="t1"><{p}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}> <span class="t2"><code class="attribute name">class</code>="<code class="attribute value">x</code>"</span><ul><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}> <span class="t2"><code class="attribute name">class</code>="<code class="attribute value">x</code>"</span><ul><li class="t1"><{b}> <span class="t2"><code class="attribute name">class</code>="<code class="attribute value">x</code>"</span><ul><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t1"><{b}> <span class="t2"><code class="attribute name">class</code>="<code class="attribute value">x</code>"</span><ul><li class="t1"><{b}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: X&#x23CE;</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="t1"><{p}><ul><li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: X&#x23CE;</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

  Note how the second <{p}> element in the markup has no explicit <code>b</code>
  elements, but in the resulting DOM, up to three of each kind of formatting element (in this case
  three <{b}> elements with the class attribute, and two unadorned <{b}> elements)
  get reconstructed before the element's "X".

  Also note how this means that in the final paragraph only six <code>b</code> end tags are
  needed to completely clear the <a>list of active formatting elements</a>, even though nine <code>b</code> start
  tags have been seen up to this point.

<h3 id="serializing-html-fragments">Serializing HTML fragments</h3>

    <li>The result of the algorithm is the string <var>s</var>.</li>

  </ol>

  <p class="warning">It is possible that the output of this algorithm, if parsed with an <a>HTML
  parser</a>, will not return the original tree structure.</p>

  <div class="example">
    For instance, if a <{textarea}> element to which a <code>Comment</code> node
    has been appended is serialized and the output is then reparsed, the comment will end up being
    displayed in the text field. Similarly, if, as a result of DOM manipulation, an element contains
    a comment that contains the literal string "<code>--&gt;</code>", then when the result
    of serializing the element is parsed, the comment will be truncated at that point and the rest of
    the comment will be interpreted as markup. More examples would be making a <code>script</code>
    element contain a <code>Text</code> node with the text string "<code>&lt;/script></code>", or
    having a <{p}> element that contains a <{ul}> element (as the <code>ul</code>
    element's <a>start tag</a> would imply the end tag for the
    <code>p</code>).

    This can enable cross-site scripting attacks. An example of this would be a page that lets the
    user enter some font family names that are then inserted into a CSS <code>style</code> block via
    the DOM and which then uses the <code>innerHTML</code> IDL attribute to get
    the HTML serialization of that <{style}> element: if the user enters
    "<code>&lt;/style>&lt;script>attack&lt;/script></code>" as a font family name, <code>innerHTML</code> will return markup that, if parsed in a different context,
    would contain a <code>script</code> node, even though no <code>script</code> node existed in the
    original DOM.

  <dfn>Escaping a string</dfn> (for the purposes of the algorithm above)
  consists of running the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>Replace any occurrence of the "<code>&amp;</code>" character by the string "<code>&amp;amp;</code>".</li>

    <li>Replace any occurrences of the U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE character by the string "<code>&amp;nbsp;</code>".</li>

    <li>If the algorithm was invoked in the <i>attribute mode</i>, replace any occurrences of the
    "<code>&quot;</code>" character by the string "<code>&amp;quot;</code>".</li>

    <li>If the algorithm was <em>not</em> invoked in the <i>attribute mode</i>, replace any
    occurrences of the "<code>&lt;</code>" character by the string "<code>&amp;lt;</code>", and any occurrences of the "<code>&gt;</code>" character by
    the string "<code>&amp;gt;</code>".</li>

<h3 id="parsing-html-fragments">Parsing HTML fragments</h3>

  The following steps form the
  <dfn lt="that algorithm|HTML fragment parsing algorithm">HTML fragment parsing algorithm</dfn>.
  The algorithm takes as input an {{Element}} node, referred to as the <dfn>context</dfn> element,

  <p class="note">
