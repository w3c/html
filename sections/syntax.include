<dfn>The HTML syntax</dfn> {#syntax}
==========================

  <p class="note">This section only describes the rules for resources labeled with an
  [=HTML MIME type=]. Rules for XML resources are discussed in the section below entitled
  "[=The XML syntax=]".</p>

## Writing HTML documents ## {#writing-html-documents}

  *This section only applies to documents, authoring tools, and markup generators. In particular, it
  does not apply to conformance checkers; conformance checkers must use the requirements given in
  the next section ("parsing HTML documents").*

  Documents must consist of the following parts, in the given order:

  1. Optionally, a single U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK (BOM) character.
  2. Any number of [=comments=] and [=space characters=].
  3. A [=DOCTYPE=].
  4. Any number of [=comments=] and [=space characters=].
  5. The [=document element=], in the form of an <{html}> element.
  6. Any number of [=comments=] and [=space characters=].

  The various types of content mentioned above are described in the next few sections.

  In addition, there are some restrictions on how [=character encoding declarations=] are to be
  serialized, as discussed in the section on that topic.

  <div class="note">
    Space characters before the <{html}> element, and space characters at the start of the <{html}>
    element and before the <{head}> element, will be dropped when the document is parsed; space
    characters *after* the <{html}> element will be parsed as if they were at the end of the
    <{body}> element. Thus, space characters around the [=document element=] do not round-trip.

    It is suggested that newlines be inserted after the DOCTYPE, after any comments that are before
    the [=document element=], after the <{html}> element's start tag (if it is not [=omitted=]), and
    after any comments that are inside the <{html}> element but before the <{head}> element.
  </div>

  Many strings in the HTML syntax (e.g., the names of elements and their attributes) are
  case-insensitive, but only for [=uppercase ASCII letters=] and [=lowercase ASCII letters=]. For
  convenience, in this section this is just referred to as "case-insensitive".

### The DOCTYPE ### {#the-doctype}

  A <dfn>DOCTYPE</dfn> is a required preamble.

  <p class="note">DOCTYPEs are required for legacy reasons. When omitted, browsers tend to use a
  different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications. Including the DOCTYPE in a
  document ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant
  specifications.</p>

  A DOCTYPE must consist of the following components, in this order:

  <!-- Editor's note: See Issue https://github.com/w3c/html/issues/729 around the obsolete permitted
  DOCTYPE string -->

  <ol class="brief">
    1. A string that is an [=ASCII case-insensitive=] match for the string "`&lt;!DOCTYPE`".
    2. One or more [=space characters=].
    3. A string that is an [=ASCII case-insensitive=] match for the string "`html`".
    4. Optionally, a [=DOCTYPE legacy string=].
    5. Zero or more [=space characters=].
    6. A U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN character (&gt;).
  </ol>

  <p class="note">In other words, <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html></code>, case-insensitively.</p>

  For the purposes of HTML generators that cannot output HTML markup with the short DOCTYPE
  "<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html></code>", a <dfn>DOCTYPE legacy string</dfn> may be inserted
  into the DOCTYPE (in the position defined above). This string must consist of:

  <ol class="brief">
    1. One or more [=space characters=].
    2. A string that is an [=ASCII case-insensitive=] match for the string "<code>SYSTEM</code>".
    3. One or more [=space characters=].
    4. A U+0022 QUOTATION MARK or U+0027 APOSTROPHE character (the |quote mark|).
    5. The literal string "<code>about:legacy-compat</code>".
    6. A matching U+0022 QUOTATION MARK or U+0027 APOSTROPHE character (i.e., the same character as
        in the earlier step labeled |quote mark|).
  </ol>

  <p class="note">In other words, <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "about:legacy-compat"></code> or
  <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM 'about:legacy-compat'></code>, case-insensitively except for the
  part in single or double quotes.</p>

  The [=DOCTYPE legacy string=] should not be used unless the document is generated from a system
  that cannot output the shorter string.

### Elements ### {#writing-html-documents-elements}

  There are six different <dfn lt="kind of element|kinds of elements">kinds of elements</dfn>:
  [=void elements=], the <{template}> elements, [=raw text elements=], [=escapable raw text elements=], [=foreign elements=],
  and [=normal elements=].

  : <dfn>Void elements</dfn>
  :: <{area}>, <{base}>, <{br}>, <{col}>, <{embed}>, <{hr}>, <{img}>, <{input}>, <{link}>, <{meta}>,
      <{param}>, <{source}>, <{track}>, <{wbr}>

  : <dfn>The <{template}> elements</dfn>
  :: <{template}>

  : <dfn lt="raw text|raw text elements">Raw text elements</dfn>
  :: <{script}>, <{style}>

  : <dfn lt="escapable raw text|escapable raw text elements">escapable raw text elements</dfn>
  :: <{textarea}>, <{title}>

  : <dfn>Foreign elements</dfn>
  :: Elements from the [=MathML namespace=] and the [=SVG namespace=].

  : <dfn lt="normal elements">Normal elements</dfn>
  :: All other allowed [=HTML elements=] are normal elements.

  <dfn>Tags</dfn> are used to delimit the start and end of elements in the markup. [=Raw text=],
  [=escapable raw text=], and [=normal elements=] have a [=start tag=] to indicate where they begin,
  and an [=end tag=] to indicate where they end. The start and end tags of certain
  [=normal elements=] can be omitted, as described in the section on [=omitted|optional tags=].
  Those that cannot be omitted must not be omitted. [=Void elements=] only have a start tag; end
  tags must not be specified for [=void elements=]. [=Foreign elements=] must either have a start
  tag and an end tag, or a start tag that is marked as self-closing, in which case they must not
  have an end tag.

  The <a lt="element content">contents</a> of the element must be placed between just after the start tag (which
  [=omitted|might be implied, in certain cases=]) and just before the end tag (which again,
  [=omitted|might be implied, in certain cases=]). The exact allowed contents of each individual
  element depend on the [=content model=] of that element, as described earlier in this
  specification. Elements must not contain content that their content model disallows. In addition
  to the restrictions placed on the contents by those content models, however, the five types of
  elements have additional *syntactic* requirements.

  [=Void elements=] can't have any contents (since there's no end tag, no content can be put between
  the start tag and the end tag).

  <p id="template-syntax"><span>The <{template}> element</span> can have <a>template contents</a>, but such <a>template contents</a> are not children of the <{template}> element itself. Instead, they are stored in a {{DocumentFragment}} associated with a different {{Document}} — without a [=browsing context=] — so as to avoid the <{template}> contents interfering with the main {{Document}}. The markup for the <a>template contents</a> of a <{template}> element is placed just after the <{template}> element's start tag and just before <{template}> element's end tag (as with other elements), and may consist of any [=text=], [=character references=], [=kind of element|elements=], and [=comments=], but the text must not contain the character U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN (&lt;) or an [=ambiguous ampersand=].</p>

  [=Raw text elements=] can have [=text=], though it has
  [[#restrictions-on-the-contents-of-raw-text-and-escapable-raw-text-elements|restrictions]]
  described below.

  [=Escapable raw text elements=] can have [=text=] and [=character references=], but the text must
  not contain an [=ambiguous ampersand=]. There are also
  [[#restrictions-on-the-contents-of-raw-text-and-escapable-raw-text-elements|further restrictions]]
  described below.

  [=Foreign elements=] whose start tag is marked as self-closing can't have any contents (since,
  again, as there's no end tag, no content can be put between the start tag and the end tag).
  [=Foreign elements=] whose start tag is *not* marked as self-closing can have [=text=],
  [=character references=], [=CDATA sections=], other [=kind of element|elements=], and
  [=comments=], but the text must not contain the character U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN (&lt;) or an
  [=ambiguous ampersand=].

  <div class="note">
    The HTML syntax does not support namespace declarations, even in [=foreign elements=].

    For instance, consider the following HTML fragment:

    <xmp highlight="html" class="bad">
      <p>
        <svg>
          <metadata>
            <!-- this is invalid -->
            <cdr:license xmlns:cdr="https://www.example.com/cdr/metadata" name="MIT"/>
          </metadata>
        </svg>
      </p>
    </xmp>

    The innermost element, <code>cdr:license</code>, is actually in the [=SVG namespace=], as the
    "<code>xmlns:cdr</code>" attribute has no effect (unlike in XML). In fact, as the comment in the
    fragment above says, the fragment is actually non-conforming. This is because the SVG
    specification does not define any elements called "<code>cdr:license</code>" in the
    [=SVG namespace=].
  </div>

  [=Normal elements=] can have [=text=], [=character references=], other
  [=kind of element|elements=], and [=comments=], but the text must not contain the character U+003C
  LESS-THAN SIGN (&lt;) or an [=ambiguous ampersand=]. Some [=normal elements=] also have
  [[#restrictions-on-content-models|yet more restrictions]] on what content they are allowed to
  hold, beyond the restrictions imposed by the content model and those described in this paragraph.
  Those restrictions are described below.

  Tags contain a <dfn>tag name</dfn>, giving the element's name. HTML elements all have names that
  only use [=alphanumeric ASCII characters=]. In the HTML syntax, tag names, even those for
  [=foreign elements=], may be written with any mix of lower- and uppercase letters that, when
  converted to all-lowercase, matches the element's tag name; tag names are case-insensitive.

#### Start tags #### {#start-tags}

  <dfn id="syntax-start-tags">Start tags</dfn> must have the following format:

  1. The first character of a start tag must be a U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN character (&lt;).
  2. The next few characters of a start tag must be the element's [=tag name=].
  3. If there are to be any attributes in the next step, there must first be one or more
      [=space characters=].
  4. Then, the start tag may have a number of attributes, the [=attribute|syntax for which=] is
      described below. Attributes must be separated from each other by one or more
      [=space characters=].
  5. After the attributes, or after the [=tag name=] if there are no attributes, there may be one or
      more [=space characters=]. (Some attributes are required to be followed by a space. See
      [[#elements-attributes]] below.)
  6. Then, if the element is one of the [=void elements=], or if the element is a
      [=foreign element=], then there may be a single U+002F SOLIDUS character (/). This character
      has no effect on [=void elements=], but on [=foreign elements=] it marks the start tag as
      self-closing.
  7. Finally, start tags must be closed by a U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN character (&gt;).

#### End tags #### {#end-tags}

  <dfn id="syntax-end-tags">End tags</dfn> must have the following format:

  1. The first character of an end tag must be a U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN character (&lt;).
  2. The second character of an end tag must be a U+002F SOLIDUS character (/).
  3. The next few characters of an end tag must be the element's [=tag name=].
  4. After the tag name, there may be one or more [=space characters=].
  5. Finally, end tags must be closed by a U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN character (&gt;).

#### Attributes #### {#elements-attributes}

  <dfn>Attributes</dfn> for an element are expressed inside the element's start tag.

  Attributes have a name and a value. <dfn>Attribute names</dfn> must consist of one or more
  characters other than the [=space characters=], U+0000 NULL, U+0022 QUOTATION MARK ("),
  U+0027 APOSTROPHE ('), U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN (&gt;), U+002F SOLIDUS (/), and U+003D EQUALS
  SIGN (=) characters, the [=control characters=], and any characters that are not defined by
  Unicode. In the HTML syntax, attribute names, even those for [=foreign elements=], may be written
  with any mix of lower- and uppercase letters that are an [=ASCII case-insensitive=] match for the
  attribute's name.

  <dfn>Attribute values</dfn> are a mixture of [=text=] and [=character references=], except with
  the additional restriction that the text cannot contain an [=ambiguous ampersand=].

  Attributes can be specified in four different ways:

  : Empty attribute syntax
  :: Just the [=attribute name=]. The value is implicitly the empty string.

      <div class="example">
        In the following example, the <{input/disabled}> attribute is given with the empty attribute
        syntax:

        <xmp highlight="html">
          <input disabled>
        </xmp>
      </div>

      If an attribute using the empty attribute syntax is to be followed by another attribute, then
      there must be a [=space character=] separating the two.

  : <dfn lt="unquoted">Unquoted attribute value syntax</dfn>
  :: The [=attribute name=], followed by zero or more [=space characters=], followed by a single
      U+003D EQUALS SIGN character, followed by zero or more [=space characters=], followed by the
      [=attribute value=], which, in addition to the requirements given above for attribute values,
      must not contain any literal [=space characters=], any U+0022 QUOTATION MARK characters
      ("), U+0027 APOSTROPHE characters ('), U+003D EQUALS SIGN characters (=), U+003C
      LESS-THAN SIGN characters (&lt;), U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN characters (&gt;), or U+0060 GRAVE
      ACCENT characters (&#x60;), and must not be the empty string.

      <div class="example">
        In the following example, the <{input/value}> attribute is given with the unquoted attribute
        value syntax:

        <xmp highlight="html">
          <input value=yes>
        </xmp>
      </div>

      If an attribute using the unquoted attribute syntax is to be followed by another attribute or
      by the optional U+002F SOLIDUS character (/) allowed in step 6 of the [=start tag=] syntax
      above, then there must be a [=space character=] separating the two.

  : Single-quoted attribute value syntax
  :: The [=attribute name=], followed by zero or more [=space characters=], followed by a single
      U+003D EQUALS SIGN character, followed by zero or more [=space characters=], followed by a
      single U+0027 APOSTROPHE character ('), followed by the [=attribute value=], which, in
      addition to the requirements given above for attribute values, must not contain any literal
      U+0027 APOSTROPHE characters ('), and finally followed by a second single U+0027 APOSTROPHE
      character (').

      <div class="example">
        In the following example, the <{input/type}> attribute is given with the single-quoted
        attribute value syntax:

        <xmp highlight="html">
          <input type='checkbox'>
        </xmp>
      </div>

      If an attribute using the single-quoted attribute syntax is to be followed by another
      attribute, then there must be a [=space character=] separating the two.

  : Double-quoted attribute value syntax
  :: The [=attribute name=], followed by zero or more [=space characters=], followed by a single
      U+003D EQUALS SIGN character, followed by zero or more [=space characters=], followed by a
      single U+0022 QUOTATION MARK character ("), followed by the [=attribute value=], which, in
      addition to the requirements given above for attribute values, must not contain any literal
      U+0022 QUOTATION MARK characters ("), and finally followed by a second single U+0022 QUOTATION
      MARK character (").

      <div class="example">
        In the following example, the <{input/name}> attribute is given with the double-quoted
        attribute value syntax:

        <xmp highlight="html">
          <input name="be good">
        </xmp>
      </div>

      If an attribute using the double-quoted attribute syntax is to be followed by another
      attribute, then there must be a [=space character=] separating the two.

  There must never be two or more attributes on the same start tag whose names are an
  [=ASCII case-insensitive=] match for each other.

  ---

  When a [=foreign element=] has one of the namespaced attributes given by the local name and
  namespace of the first and second cells of a row from the following table, it must be written
  using the name given by the third cell from the same row.

  <table>
    <thead>
    <tr><th> Local name           <th> Namespace           <th> Attribute name
    <tbody>
    <tr><td> <code>actuate</code> <td> [=XLink namespace=] <td> <{xlink/actuate|xlink:actuate}>
    <tr><td> <code>arcrole</code> <td> [=XLink namespace=] <td> <{xlink/arcrole|xlink:arcrole}>
    <tr><td> <code>href</code>    <td> [=XLink namespace=] <td> <{xlink/href|xlink:href}>
    <tr><td> <code>role</code>    <td> [=XLink namespace=] <td> <{xlink/role|xlink:role}>
    <tr><td> <code>show</code>    <td> [=XLink namespace=] <td> <{xlink/show|xlink:show}>
    <tr><td> <code>title</code>   <td> [=XLink namespace=] <td> <{xlink/title|xlink:title}>
    <tr><td> <code>type</code>    <td> [=XLink namespace=] <td> <{xlink/type|xlink:type}>
    <tr><td> <code>lang</code>    <td> [=XML namespace=]   <td> <{xml/lang|xml:lang}>
    <tr><td> <code>space</code>   <td> [=XML namespace=]   <td> <{xml/space|xml:space}>
    <tr><td> <code>xmlns</code>   <td> [=XMLNS namespace=] <td> <{xmlns/xmlns}>
    <tr><td> <code>xlink</code>   <td> [=XMLNS namespace=] <td> <{xlink/xlink|xmlns:xlink}>
  </table>

  No other namespaced attribute can be expressed in [[#syntax|the HTML syntax]].

  <p class="note">Whether the attributes in the table above are conforming or not is defined by
  other specifications (e.g., the SVG and MathML specifications); this section only describes the
  syntax rules if the attributes are serialized using the HTML syntax.</p>

#### Optional tags #### {#optional-tags}

  Certain tags can be <dfn lt="optional start and end tags|omitted">omitted</dfn>.

  <p class="note">Omitting an element's [=start tag=] in the situations described below does not
  mean the element is not present; it is implied, but it is still there. For example, an HTML
  document always has a root <{html}> element, even if the string <code>&lt;html></code> doesn't
  appear anywhere in the markup.</p>

  An <{html}> element's [=start tag=] may be omitted if the first thing inside the <{html}> element
  is not a [=comment=].

  <div class="example">
    For example, in the following case it's ok to remove the "<code>&lt;html></code>" tag:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
        <head>
          <title>Hello</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <p>Welcome to this example.</p>
        </body>
      </html>
    </xmp>

    Doing so would make the document look like this:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <!DOCTYPE html>

      <head>
        <title>Hello</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p>Welcome to this example.</p>
      </body>
      </html>
    </xmp>

    This has the exact same DOM. In particular, note that white space around the
    [=document element=] is ignored by the parser. The following example would also have the exact
    same DOM:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <!DOCTYPE html><head>
        <title>Hello</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p>Welcome to this example.</p>
      </body>
      </html>
    </xmp>

    However, in the following example, removing the start tag moves the comment to before the
    <{html}> element:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
        <!-- where is this comment in the DOM? -->
        <head>
          <title>Hello</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <p>Welcome to this example.</p>
        </body>
      </html>
    </xmp>

    With the tag removed, the document actually turns into the same as this:

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;!DOCTYPE html>
      &lt;!-- where is this comment in the DOM? -->
      <mark>&lt;html></mark>
        &lt;head>
          &lt;title>Hello&lt;/title>
        &lt;/head>
        &lt;body>
          &lt;p>Welcome to this example.&lt;/p>
        &lt;/body>
      &lt;/html>
    </pre>

    This is why the tag can only be removed if it is not followed by a comment: removing the tag
    when there is a comment there changes the document's resulting parse tree. Of course, if the
    position of the comment does not matter, then the tag can be omitted, as if the comment had been
    moved to before the start tag in the first place.
  </div>

  An <{html}> element's [=end tag=] may be omitted if the <{html}> element is not immediately
  followed by a [=comment=].

  A <{head}> element's [=start tag=] may be omitted if the element is empty, or if the first thing
  inside the <{head}> element is an element.

  A <{head}> element's [=end tag=] may be omitted if the <{head}> element is not immediately
  followed by a [=space character=] or a [=comment=].

  A <{body}> element's [=start tag=] may be omitted if the element is empty, or if the first thing
  inside the <{body}> element is not a [=space character=] or a [=comment=], except if the first
  thing inside the <{body}> element is a <{meta}>, <{link}>, <{script}>, <{style}>, or <{template}>
  element.

  A <{body}> element's [=end tag=] may be omitted if the <{body}> element is not immediately
  followed by a [=comment=].

  <div class="example">
    Note that in the example above, the <{head}> element start and end tags, and the <{body}>
    element start tag, can't be omitted, because they are surrounded by white space:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
        <head>
          <title>Hello</title>
        </head>
        <body>
          <p>Welcome to this example.</p>
        </body>
      </html>
    </xmp>

    (The <{body}> and <{html}> element end tags could be omitted without trouble; any spaces after
    those get parsed into the <{body}> element anyway.)

    Usually, however, white space isn't an issue. If we first remove the white space we don't care
    about:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Hello</title></head><body><p>Welcome to this example.</p></body></html>
    </xmp>

    Then we can omit a number of tags without affecting the DOM:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <!DOCTYPE html><title>Hello</title><p>Welcome to this example.</p>
    </xmp>

    At that point, we can also add some white space back:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <title>Hello</title>
      <p>Welcome to this example.</p>
    </xmp>

    This would be equivalent to this document, with the omitted tags shown in their parser-implied
    positions; the only white space text node that results from this is the newline at the end of
    the <{head}> element:

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;!DOCTYPE html>
      <mark>&lt;html>&lt;head></mark>&lt;title>Hello&lt;/title>
      <mark>&lt;/head>&lt;body></mark>&lt;p>Welcome to this example.&lt;/p><mark>&lt;/body>&lt;/html></mark>
    </pre>

  <div class="example">
    The ability to omit all these table-related tags makes table markup much terser.

    Take this example:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <table>
        <caption>37547 TEE Electric Powered Rail Car Train Functions (Abbreviated)</caption>
        <colgroup>
          <col>
          <col>
          <col>
        </colgroup>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Function</th>
            <th>Control Unit</th>
            <th>Central Station</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Headlights</td>
            <td>✔</td>
            <td>✔</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Interior Lights</td>
            <td>✔</td>
            <td>✔</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Electric locomotive operating sounds</td>
            <td>✔</td>
            <td>✔</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Engineer's cab lighting</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>✔</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Station Announcements - Swiss</td>
            <td></td>
            <td>✔</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </xmp>

    The exact same table could be marked up as follows:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <table>
      <caption>37547 TEE Electric Powered Rail Car Train Functions (Abbreviated)
      <colgroup><col><col><col>
      <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Function
        <th>Control Unit
        <th>Central Station
      <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Headlights
        <td>✔
        <td>✔
      <tr>
        <td>Interior Lights
        <td>✔
        <td>✔
      <tr>
        <td>Electric locomotive operating sounds

      <tr>
        <td>Station Announcements - Swiss
        <td>
        <td>✔
      </table>
    </xmp>

    Since the cells take up much less room this way, this can be made even terser by having each row
    on one line:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <table>
      <caption>37547 TEE Electric Powered Rail Car Train Functions (Abbreviated)
      <colgroup><col><col><col>
      <thead>
      <tr> <th>Function                              <th>Control Unit     <th>Central Station
      <tbody>
      <tr> <td>Headlights                            <td>✔                <td>✔
      <tr> <td>Interior Lights                       <td>✔                <td>✔
      <tr> <td>Electric locomotive operating sounds  <td>✔                <td>✔
      <tr> <td>Engineer's cab lighting               <td>                 <td>✔
      <tr> <td>Station Announcements - Swiss         <td>                 <td>✔
      </table>
    </xmp>

    The only differences between these tables, at the DOM level, is with the precise position of the
    white space. This makes no difference to the parsing and the meaning is unchanged.
  </div>

  <strong>However</strong>, a [=start tag=] must never be omitted if it has any attributes.

  <div class="example">
    Returning to the earlier example with all the white space removed and then all the optional tags
    removed:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <!DOCTYPE html><title>Hello</title><p>Welcome to this example.
    </xmp>

    If the <{body}> element in this example had to have a <{global/class}> attribute and the
    <{html}> element had to have a <{global/lang}> attribute, the markup would have to become:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><title>Hello</title><body class="demo"><p>Welcome to this example.
    </xmp>
  </div>

  <p class="note">This section assumes that the document is conforming, in particular, that there
  are no [=content model=] violations. Omitting tags in the fashion described in this section in a
  document that does not conform to the [=content models=] described in this specification is likely
  to result in unexpected DOM differences (this is, in part, what the content models are designed to
  avoid).</p>

#### Restrictions on content models #### {#restrictions-on-content-models}

  For historical reasons, certain elements have extra restrictions beyond even the restrictions
  given by their content model.

  A <{table}> element must not contain <{tr}> elements, even though these elements are technically
  allowed inside <{table}> elements according to the content models described in this specification.
  (If a <{tr}> element is put inside a <{table}> in the markup, it will in fact imply a <{tbody}>
  start tag before it.)

  A single [[#newlines|newline]] may be placed immediately after the [=start tag=] of <{pre}> and
  <{textarea}> elements. This does not affect the processing of the element. The otherwise optional
  [[#newlines|newline]] *must* be included if the element's contents themselves start with a
  [[#newlines|newline]] (because otherwise the leading newline in the contents would be treated like
  the optional newline, and ignored).

  <div class="example">
    The following two <{pre}> blocks are equivalent:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <pre>Hello</pre>
    </xmp>

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <pre>
      Hello</pre>
    </xmp>
  </div>

#### Restrictions on the contents of raw text and escapable raw text elements #### {#restrictions-on-the-contents-of-raw-text-and-escapable-raw-text-elements}

  The text in [=raw text=] and [=escapable raw text elements=] must not contain any occurrences of
  the string "<code>&lt;/</code>" (U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN, U+002F SOLIDUS) followed by characters
  that case-insensitively match the tag name of the element followed by one of U+0009 CHARACTER
  TABULATION (tab), U+000A LINE FEED (LF), U+000C FORM FEED (FF), U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR),
  U+0020 SPACE, U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN (>), or U+002F SOLIDUS (/).

### Text ### {#writing-text}

  Text is allowed inside elements, attribute values, and comments. Extra constraints are placed on
  what is and what is not allowed in text based on where the text is to be put, as described in the
  other sections.

#### Newlines #### {#newlines}

  Newlines in HTML may be represented either as U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters, U+000A LINE
  FEED (LF) characters, or pairs of U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR), U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters in
  that order.

  Where [=character references=] are allowed, a character reference of a U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
  character (but not a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) character) also represents a
  [[#newlines|newline]].

### Character references ### {#character-references}

  In certain cases described in other sections, [=text=] may be mixed with
  <dfn id="syntax-charref">character references</dfn>. These can be used to escape characters that
  couldn't otherwise legally be included in [=text=].

  Character references must start with a U+0026 AMPERSAND character (&amp;). Following this, there
  are three possible kinds of character references:

  : Named character references
  :: The ampersand must be followed by one of the names given in [[#named-character-references]]
      section, using the same case. The name must be one that is terminated by a U+003B SEMICOLON
      character (;).

  : Decimal numeric character reference
  :: The ampersand must be followed by a U+0023 NUMBER SIGN character (#), followed by one or more
      [=ASCII digits=], representing a base-ten integer that corresponds to a Unicode code point
      that is allowed according to the definition below. The digits must then be followed by a
      U+003B SEMICOLON character (;).

  : Hexadecimal numeric character reference
  :: The ampersand must be followed by a U+0023 NUMBER SIGN character (#), which must be followed by
      either a U+0078 LATIN SMALL LETTER X character (x) or a U+0058 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER X
      character (X), which must then be followed by one or more [=ASCII hex digits=],
      representing a hexadecimal integer that corresponds to a Unicode code point that is allowed
      according to the definition below. The digits must then be followed by a U+003B SEMICOLON
      character (;).
  
  The numeric character reference forms described above are allowed to reference any Unicode code
  point but not:

  * permanently undefined Unicode characters (noncharacters)
  * surrogates (U+D800—U+DFFF)
  * control codes (U+0000—U+001F and U+007F—U+009F), with the exception of the following numeric
    character references which are allowed:
    * `&#x9;` or `&#9;`  - representing U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (␉)
    * `&#xA;` or `&#10;` - representing U+000A LINE FEED (␊)
    * `&#xC;` or `&#12;` - representing U+000C FORM FEED (␌)

  An <dfn>ambiguous ampersand</dfn> is a U+0026 AMPERSAND character (&amp;) that is followed by one
  or more [=alphanumeric ASCII characters=], followed by a U+003B SEMICOLON character (;), where
  these characters do not match any of the names given in the [[#named-character-references]]
  section.

### CDATA sections ### {#cdata-sections}

  <dfn id="syntax-cdata">CDATA sections</dfn> must consist of the following components, in this
  order:

  1. The string "<code>&lt;![CDATA[</code>".
  2. Optionally, [=text=], with the additional restriction that the text must not contain the string
      "<code>]]&gt;</code>".
  3. The string "<code>]]&gt;</code>".

  <div class="example">
    CDATA sections can only be used in foreign content (MathML or SVG). In this example, a CDATA
    section is used to escape the contents of a MathML <{ms}> element:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <p>You can add a string to a number, but this stringifies the number:</p>
      <math>
        <ms><![CDATA[x<y]]></ms>
        <mo>+</mo>
        <mn>3</mn>
        <mo>=</mo>
        <ms><![CDATA[x<y3]]></ms>
      </math>
    </xmp>
  </div>

### Comments ### {#comments}

  <dfn id="syntax-comments">Comments</dfn> must have the following format:

  1. The string "<code>&lt;!--</code>"
  2. Optionally, [=text=], with the additional restriction that the text must not start with the
      string "<code>></code>", nor start with the string "<code>-></code>", nor contain the strings
      "<code>&lt;!--</code>", "<code>--></code>", or "<code>--!></code>", nor end with the string
      "<code>&lt;!-</code>".
  3. The string "<code>--></code>"

  <p class="note">The [=text=] is allowed to end with the string "<code>&lt;!</code>", as in
  <code>&lt;!--My favorite operators are > and &lt;!--></code>.</p>

## Parsing HTML documents ## {#parsing-html-documents}

  *This section only applies to user agents, data mining tools, and conformance checkers.*

  <p class="note">The rules for parsing XML documents into DOM trees are covered by the next
  section, entitled "[[#xhtml]]".</p>

  User agents must use the parsing rules described in this section to generate the DOM trees from
  <code>[[#text-html|text/html]]</code> resources. Together, these rules define what is referred to
  as the <dfn>HTML parser</dfn>.

  <div class="note">
    While the HTML syntax described in this specification bears a close resemblance to SGML and XML,
    it is a separate language with its own parsing rules.

    Some earlier versions of HTML (in particular from HTML 2.0 to HTML 4.01) were based on SGML and
    used SGML parsing rules. However, few (if any) web browsers ever implemented true SGML parsing
    for HTML documents; the only user agents to strictly handle HTML as an SGML application have
    historically been validators. The resulting confusion — with validators claiming documents
    to have one representation while widely deployed Web browsers interoperably implemented a
    different representation — has wasted decades of productivity. This version of HTML thus
    returns to a non-SGML basis.

    Authors interested in using SGML tools in their authoring pipeline are encouraged to use XML
    tools and the XML serialization of HTML.
  </div>

  This specification defines the parsing rules for HTML documents, whether they are syntactically
  correct or not. Certain points in the parsing algorithm are said to be <dfn>parse errors</dfn>.
  The error handling for parse errors is well-defined (that's the processing rules described
  throughout this specification), but user agents, while parsing an HTML document, may
  [=abort the parser=] at the first [=parse error=] that they encounter for which they do not wish
  to apply the rules described in this specification.

  Conformance checkers must report at least one [=parse error=] condition to the user if one or
  more [=parse error=] conditions exist in the document and must not report [=parse error=]
  conditions if none exist in the document. Conformance checkers may report more than one
  [=parse error=] condition if more than one [=parse error=] condition exists in the document.

  <p class="note">[=Parse errors=] are only errors with the *syntax* of HTML. In addition to
  checking for [=parse errors=], conformance checkers will also verify that the document obeys all
  the other conformance requirements described in this specification.</p>

  For the purposes of conformance checkers, if a resource is determined to be in
  [[#syntax|the HTML syntax]], then it is an [=HTML document=].

  <p class="note">As stated in the terminology section, references to [=element types=] that do
  not explicitly specify a namespace always refer to elements in the [=HTML namespace=]. Where possible, references to such elements are hyperlinked to their
  definition.</p>

### Overview of the parsing model ### {#overview-of-the-parsing-model}

  <img src="images/parsing-model-overview.png" width="345" height="450" alt="" />

  The input to the HTML parsing process consists of a stream of [=Unicode code points=], which is
  passed through a [[#tokenization|tokenization]] stage followed by a tree construction stage. The
  output is a {{Document}} object.

  <p class="note">Implementations that [=do not support scripting=] do not have to actually create a
  DOM {{Document}} object, but the DOM tree in such cases is still used as the model for the rest of
  the specification.</p>

  In the common case, the data handled by the tokenization stage comes from the network, but
  [=it can also come from script=] running in the user agent, e.g., using the
  {{Document/write()|document.write()}} API.

  There is only one set of states for the tokenizer stage and the tree construction stage, but the
  tree construction stage is <dfn>reentrant</dfn>, meaning that while the tree construction stage is
  handling one token, the tokenizer might be resumed, causing further tokens to be emitted and
  processed before the first token's processing is complete.

  <div class="example">
    In the following example, the tree construction stage will be called upon to handle a "`p`"
    start tag token while handling the "`script`" end tag token:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      ...
      <script>
        document.write('<p>');
      </script>
      ...
    </xmp>
  </div>

  To handle these cases, parsers have a <dfn>script nesting level</dfn>, which must be initially set
  to zero, and a <dfn>parser pause flag</dfn>, which must be initially set to false.

### The <dfn>input byte stream</dfn> ### {#the-input-byte-stream}

  The stream of Unicode code points that comprises the input to the tokenization stage will be
  initially seen by the user agent as a stream of bytes (typically coming over the network or from
  the local file system). The bytes encode the actual characters according to a particular
  *character encoding*, which the user agent uses to decode the bytes into characters.

  <p class="note">For XML documents, the algorithm user agents are required to use to determine the
  character encoding is given by the XML specification. This section does not apply to XML
  documents. [[!XML]]</p>

  Usually, the [=encoding sniffing algorithm=] defined below is used to determine the character
  encoding.

  Given a character encoding, the bytes in the [=input byte stream=] must be converted to characters
  for the tokenizer's [=input stream=], by passing the [=input byte stream=] and character encoding
  to <a for="/">decode</a>.

  <p class="note">A leading Byte Order Mark (BOM) causes the character encoding argument to be
  ignored and will itself be skipped.</p>

  <p class="note">Bytes or sequences of bytes in the original byte stream that did not conform to
  the Encoding specification (e.g., invalid UTF-8 byte sequences in a UTF-8 input byte stream) are
  errors that conformance checkers are expected to report. [[!ENCODING]]</p>

  <p class="warning">The decoder algorithms describe how to handle invalid input; for security
  reasons, it is imperative that those rules be followed precisely. Differences in how invalid byte
  sequences are handled can result in, amongst other problems, script injection vulnerabilities
  ("XSS").</p>

  When the HTML parser is decoding an input byte stream, it uses a character encoding and a
  <dfn>confidence</dfn>. The confidence is either *tentative*, *certain*, or *irrelevant*. The
  encoding used, and whether the confidence in that encoding is *tentative* or *certain*, is
  [=used during the parsing=] to determine whether to [=change the encoding=]. If no encoding is
  necessary, e.g., because the parser is operating on a Unicode stream and doesn't have to use a
  character encoding at all, then the [=confidence=] is *irrelevant*.

  <p class="note">Some algorithms feed the parser by directly adding characters to the
  [=input stream=] rather than adding bytes to the [=input byte stream=].</p>

#### Parsing with a known character encoding #### {#parsing-with-a-known-character-encoding}

  When the HTML parser is to operate on an input byte stream that has
  <dfn>a known definite encoding</dfn>, then the character encoding is that encoding and the
  [=confidence=] is *certain*.

#### Determining the character encoding #### {#determining-the-character-encoding}

  In some cases, it might be impractical to unambiguously determine the encoding before parsing
  the document. Because of this, this specification provides for a two-pass mechanism with an
  optional pre-scan. Implementations are allowed, as described below, to apply a simplified parsing
  algorithm to whatever bytes they have available before beginning to parse the document. Then, the
  real parser is started, using a tentative encoding derived from this pre-parse and other
  out-of-band metadata. If, while the document is being loaded, the user agent discovers a character
  encoding declaration that conflicts with this information, then the parser can get reinvoked to
  perform a parse of the document with the real encoding.

  User agents must use the following algorithm, called the <dfn>encoding sniffing algorithm</dfn>,
  to determine the character encoding to use when decoding a document in the first pass. This
  algorithm takes as input any out-of-band metadata available to the user agent (e.g., the
  [=Content-Type metadata=] of the document) and all the bytes available so far, and returns a
  character encoding and a [=confidence=] that is either *tentative* or *certain*.

  1. If the user has explicitly instructed the user agent to override the document's character
      encoding with a specific encoding, optionally return that encoding with the [=confidence=]
      *certain* and abort these steps.

      <p class="note">Typically, user agents remember such user requests across sessions, and in
      some cases apply them to documents in <{iframe}>s as well.</p>
  2. The user agent may wait for more bytes of the resource to be available, either in this step or
      at any later step in this algorithm. For instance, a user agent might wait 500ms or 1024
      bytes, whichever came first. In general preparsing the source to find the encoding improves
      performance, as it reduces the need to throw away the data structures used when parsing upon
      finding the encoding information. However, if the user agent delays too long to obtain data to
      determine the encoding, then the cost of the delay could outweigh any performance improvements
      from the preparse.

      <p class="note">The authoring conformance requirements for character encoding declarations
      limit them to only appearing in [=the first 1024 bytes=]. User agents are therefore encouraged
      to use the prescan algorithm below (as invoked by these steps) on the first 1024 bytes, but
      not to stall beyond that.</p>
  3. If the transport layer specifies a character encoding, and it is supported, return that
      encoding with the [=confidence=] *certain*, and abort these steps.
  4. Optionally
      [=prescan a byte stream to determine its encoding|prescan the byte stream to determine its encoding=].
      The |end condition| is that the user agent decides that scanning further bytes would not be
      efficient. User agents are encouraged to only prescan [=the first 1024 bytes=]. User agents
      may decide that scanning *any* bytes is not efficient, in which case these substeps are
      entirely skipped.

      The aforementioned algorithm either aborts unsuccessfully or returns a character encoding. If
      it returns a character encoding, then this algorithm must be aborted, returning the same
      encoding, with [=confidence=] *tentative*.
  5. If the [=HTML parser=] for which this algorithm is being run is associated with a {{Document}}
      that is itself in a [=nested browsing context=], run these substeps:

      1. Let |new document| be the {{Document}} with which the [=HTML parser=] is associated.
      2. Let |parent document| be the {{Document}}
          <a lt="nested through">through which |new document| is nested</a> (the [=active document=] of the
          [=parent browsing context=] of |new document|).
      3. If |parent document|'s [=concept/origin=] is not the [=same origin=] as |new document|'s
          [=concept/origin=], then abort these substeps.
      4. If |parent document|'s [=character encoding=] is not an [=ASCII-compatible encoding=], then
          abort these substeps.
      5. Return |parent document|'s [=character encoding=], with the [=confidence=] *tentative*, and
          abort the [=encoding sniffing algorithm=]'s steps.
  6. Otherwise, if the user agent has information on the likely encoding for this page, e.g., based
      on the encoding of the page when it was last visited, then return that encoding, with the
      [=confidence=] *tentative*, and abort these steps.
  7. The user agent may attempt to autodetect the character encoding from applying frequency
      analysis or other algorithms to the data stream. Such algorithms may use information about the
      resource other than the resource's contents, including the address of the resource. If
      autodetection succeeds in determining a character encoding, and that encoding is a supported
      encoding, then return that encoding, with the [=confidence=] *tentative*, and abort these
      steps. [[UNIVCHARDET]]

      <p class="note">User agents are generally discouraged from attempting to autodetect encodings
      for resources obtained over the network, since doing so involves inherently non-interoperable
      heuristics. Attempting to detect encodings based on an HTML document's preamble is especially
      tricky since HTML markup typically uses only ASCII characters, and HTML documents tend to
      begin with a lot of markup rather than with text content.</p>

      <p class="note">The UTF-8 encoding has a highly detectable bit pattern. Files from the local
      file system that contain bytes with values greater than 0x7F which match the UTF-8 pattern are
      very likely to be UTF-8, while documents with byte sequences that do not match it are very
      likely not. When a user agent can examine the whole file, rather than just the preamble,
      detecting for UTF-8 specifically can be especially effective. [[PPUTF8]] [[UTF8DET]]</p>
  8. Otherwise, return an implementation-defined or user-specified default character encoding, with
      the [=confidence=] *tentative*.

      In controlled environments or in environments where the encoding of documents can be
      prescribed (for example, for user agents intended for dedicated use in new networks), the
      comprehensive <a>`UTF-8`</a> encoding is suggested.

      In other environments, the default encoding is typically dependent on the user's locale (an
      approximation of the languages, and thus often encodings, of the pages that the user is likely
      to frequent). The following table gives suggested defaults based on the user's locale, for
      compatibility with legacy content. Locales are identified by BCP 47 language tags. [[!BCP47]]

  The [=document's character encoding=] must immediately be set to the value returned from this
  algorithm, at the same time as the user agent uses the returned value to select the decoder to use
  for the input byte stream.

  ---

  When an algorithm requires a user agent to
  <dfn>prescan a byte stream to determine its encoding</dfn>, given some defined |end condition|,
  then it must run the following steps. These steps either abort unsuccessfully or return a
  character encoding. If at any point during these steps (including during instances of the
  [=get an attribute=] algorithm invoked by this one) the user agent either runs out of bytes
  (meaning the |position| pointer created in the first step below goes beyond the end of the byte
  stream obtained so far) or reaches its |end condition|, then abort the
  [=prescan a byte stream to determine its encoding=] algorithm unsuccessfully.

  1. Let |position| be a pointer to a byte in the input byte stream, initially pointing at the first
      byte.
  2. |Loop|: If |position| points to:

      <dl class="switch">
        : A sequence of bytes starting with: 0x3C 0x21 0x2D 0x2D (ASCII '&lt;!--')
        :: Advance the |position| pointer so that it points at the first 0x3E byte which is preceded
            by two 0x2D bytes (i.e., at the end of an ASCII '-->' sequence) and comes after the 0x3C
            byte that was found. (The two 0x2D bytes can be the same as those in the '&lt;!--'
            sequence.)

        : A sequence of bytes starting with: 0x3C, 0x4D or 0x6D, 0x45 or 0x65, 0x54 or 0x74, 0x41 or
            0x61, and one of 0x09, 0x0A, 0x0C, 0x0D, 0x20, 0x2F (case-insensitive ASCII '&lt;meta'
            followed by a space or slash)
        ::
            1. Advance the |position| pointer so that it points at the next 0x09, 0x0A, 0x0C, 0x0D,
                0x20, or 0x2F byte (the one in sequence of characters matched above).
            2. Let |attribute list| be an empty list of strings.
            3. Let |got pragma| be false.
            4. Let |need pragma| be null.
            5. Let |charset| be the null value (which, for the purposes of this algorithm, is
                distinct from an unrecognized encoding or the empty string).
            6. |Attributes|: [=Get an attribute=] and its value. If no attribute was sniffed, then
                jump to the |Processing| step below.
            7. If the attribute's name is already in |attribute list|, then return to the step
                labeled |Attributes|.
            8. Add the attribute's name to |attribute list|.
            9. Run the appropriate step from the following list, if one applies:
                <dl class="switch">
                  : If the attribute's name is "<{meta/http-equiv}>"
                  :: If the attribute's value is "`content-type`", then set |got pragma| to true.

                  : If the attribute's name is "<{meta/content}>"
                  :: Apply the
                      <a>algorithm for extracting a character encoding from a `meta` element</a>,
                      giving the attribute's value as the string to parse. If a character encoding
                      is returned, and if |charset| is still set to null, let |charset| be the
                      encoding returned, and set |need pragma| to true.

                  : If the attribute's name is "<{meta/charset}>"
                  :: Let |charset| be the result of [=getting an encoding=] from the attribute's
                      value, and set |need pragma| to false.

                </dl>
            10. Return to the step labeled |Attributes|.
            11. |Processing|: If |need pragma| is null, then jump to the step below labeled
                |Next byte|.
            12. If |need pragma| is true but |got pragma| is false, then jump to the step below
                labeled |Next byte|.
            13. If |charset| is failure, then jump to the step below labeled |Next byte|.
            14. If |charset| is a [=UTF-16 encoding=], then set |charset| to [=UTF-8=].
            15. If |charset| is [=x-user-defined=], then set |charset| to [=windows-1252=].
            16. Abort the [=prescan a byte stream to determine its encoding=] algorithm, returning
                the encoding given by |charset|.

        : A sequence of bytes starting with a 0x3C byte (ASCII &lt;), optionally a 0x2F byte
            (ASCII /), and finally a byte in the range 0x41-0x5A or 0x61-0x7A (an ASCII letter)
        ::
            1. Advance the |position| pointer so that it points at the next 0x09 (ASCII TAB), 0x0A
                (ASCII LF), 0x0C (ASCII FF), 0x0D (ASCII CR), 0x20 (ASCII space), or 0x3E (ASCII >)
                byte.
            2. Repeatedly [=get an attribute=] until no further attributes can be found, then jump
                to the step below labeled |Next byte|.

        : A sequence of bytes starting with: 0x3C 0x21 (ASCII '&lt;!')
        : A sequence of bytes starting with: 0x3C 0x2F (ASCII '&lt;/')
        : A sequence of bytes starting with: 0x3C 0x3F (ASCII '&lt;?')
        :: Advance the |position| pointer so that it points at the first 0x3E byte (ASCII >) that
            comes after the 0x3C byte that was found.

        : Any other byte
        :: Do nothing with that byte.

      </dl>
  3. |Next byte|: Move |position| so it points at the next byte in the input byte stream, and return
      to the step above labeled |Loop|.

  When the [=prescan a byte stream to determine its encoding=] algorithm says to
  <dfn>get an attribute</dfn>, it means doing this:

  1. If the byte at |position| is one of 0x09 (ASCII TAB), 0x0A (ASCII LF), 0x0C (ASCII FF), 0x0D
      (ASCII CR), 0x20 (ASCII space), or 0x2F (ASCII /) then advance |position| to the next byte and
      redo this step.
  2. If the byte at |position| is 0x3E (ASCII >), then abort the [=get an attribute=] algorithm.
      There isn't one.
  3. Otherwise, the byte at |position| is the start of the attribute name. Let |attribute name| and
      |attribute value| be the empty string.
  4. Process the byte at |position| as follows:
      <dl class="switch">
        : If it is 0x3D (ASCII =), and the |attribute name| is longer than the empty string
        :: Advance |position| to the next byte and jump to the step below labeled |Value|.

        : If it is 0x09 (ASCII TAB), 0x0A (ASCII LF), 0x0C (ASCII FF), 0x0D (ASCII CR), or 0x20
            (ASCII space)
        :: Jump to the step below labeled |Spaces|.

        : If it is 0x2F (ASCII /) or 0x3E (ASCII >)
        :: Abort the [=get an attribute=] algorithm. The attribute's name is the value of
            |attribute name|, its value is the empty string.

        : If it is in the range 0x41 (ASCII A) to 0x5A (ASCII Z)
        :: Append the Unicode character with code point |b|+0x20 to |attribute name| (where |b| is
            the value of the byte at |position|). (This converts the input to lowercase.)

        : Anything else
        :: Append the Unicode character with the same code point as the value of the byte at
            |position| to |attribute name|. (It doesn't actually matter how bytes outside the ASCII
            range are handled here, since only ASCII characters can contribute to the detection of a
            character encoding.)

      </dl>
  5. Advance |position| to the next byte and return to the previous step.
  6. |Spaces|: If the byte at |position| is one of 0x09 (ASCII TAB), 0x0A (ASCII LF), 0x0C (ASCII
      FF), 0x0D (ASCII CR), or 0x20 (ASCII space) then advance |position| to the next byte, then,
      repeat this step.
  7. If the byte at |position| is *not* 0x3D (ASCII =), abort the [=get an attribute=] algorithm.
      The attribute's name is the value of |attribute name|, its value is the empty string.
  8. Advance |position| past the 0x3D (ASCII =) byte.
  9. |Value|: If the byte at |position| is one of 0x09 (ASCII TAB), 0x0A (ASCII LF), 0x0C (ASCII
      FF), 0x0D (ASCII CR), or 0x20 (ASCII space) then advance |position| to the next byte, then,
      repeat this step.
  10. Process the byte at |position| as follows:
      <dl class="switch">
        : If it is 0x22 (ASCII ") or 0x27 (ASCII ')
        ::
            1. Let |b| be the value of the byte at |position|.
            2. |Quote loop|: Advance |position| to the next byte.
            3. If the value of the byte at |position| is the value of |b|, then advance |position|
                to the next byte and abort the [=get an attribute=] algorithm. The attribute's name
                is the value of |attribute name|, and its value is the value of |attribute value|.
            4. Otherwise, if the value of the byte at |position| is in the range 0x41 (ASCII A) to
                0x5A (ASCII Z), then append a Unicode character to |attribute value| whose code
                point is 0x20 more than the value of the byte at |position|.
            5. Otherwise, append a Unicode character to |attribute value| whose code point is the
                same as the value of the byte at |position|.
            6. Return to the step above labeled |Quote loop|.

        : If it is 0x3E (ASCII >)
        :: Abort the [=get an attribute=] algorithm. The attribute's name is the value of
            |attribute name|, its value is the empty string.

        : If it is in the range 0x41 (ASCII A) to 0x5A (ASCII Z)
        :: Append the Unicode character with code point |b|+0x20 to |attribute value| (where |b| is
            the value of the byte at |position|). Advance |position| to the next byte.

        : Anything else
        :: Append the Unicode character with the same code point as the value of the byte at
            |position| to |attribute value|. Advance |position| to the next byte.

      </dl>
  11. Process the byte at |position| as follows:
      <dl class="switch">
        : If it is 0x09 (ASCII TAB), 0x0A (ASCII LF), 0x0C (ASCII FF), 0x0D (ASCII CR), 0x20 (ASCII
            space), or 0x3E (ASCII >)
        :: Abort the [=get an attribute=] algorithm. The attribute's name is the value of
            |attribute name| and its value is the value of |attribute value|.

        : If it is in the range 0x41 (ASCII A) to 0x5A (ASCII Z)
        :: Append the Unicode character with code point |b|+0x20 to |attribute value| (where |b| is
            the value of the byte at |position|).

        : Anything else
        :: Append the Unicode character with the same code point as the value of the byte at
            |position| to |attribute value|.

      </dl>
  12. Advance |position| to the next byte and return to the previous step.

  For the sake of interoperability, user agents should not use a pre-scan algorithm that returns
  different results than the one described above. (But, if you do, please at least let us know, so
  that we can improve this algorithm and benefit everyone...)

#### Character encodings #### {#character-encodings}

  User agents must support the encodings defined in the WHATWG Encoding specification, including,
  but not limited to,
  <dfn>UTF-8</dfn>,
  <dfn>ISO-8859-2</dfn>,
  <dfn>ISO-8859-8</dfn>,
  <dfn>windows-1250</dfn>,
  <dfn>windows-1251</dfn>,
  <dfn>windows-1252</dfn>,
  <dfn>windows-1254</dfn>,
  <dfn>windows-1256</dfn>,
  <dfn>windows-1257</dfn>,

  <dfn>Big5</dfn>,
  <dfn>ISO-2022-JP</dfn>,
  <dfn>Shift_JIS</dfn>,
  <dfn>EUC-KR</dfn>,
  <dfn>UTF-16BE</dfn>,
  <dfn>UTF-16LE</dfn>, and
  <dfn>x-user-defined</dfn>.
  User agents must not support other encodings.

  <p class="note">The above prohibits supporting, for example, CESU-8, UTF-7, BOCU-1, SCSU, EBCDIC,
  and UTF-32. This specification does not make any attempt to support prohibited encodings in its
  algorithms; support and use of prohibited encodings would thus lead to unexpected behavior.
  [[CESU8]] [[RFC2152]] [[BOCU1]] [[SCSU]]</p>

#### Changing the encoding while parsing #### {#changing-the-encoding-while-parsing}

  When the parser requires the user agent to <dfn>change the encoding</dfn>, it must run the
  following steps. This might happen if the [=encoding sniffing algorithm=] described above failed
  to find a character encoding, or if it found a character encoding that was not the actual encoding
  of the file.

  1. If the encoding that is already being used to interpret the input stream is a
      [=UTF-16 encoding=], then set the [=confidence=] to *certain* and abort these steps. The new
      encoding is ignored; if it was anything but the same encoding, then it would be clearly
      incorrect.
  2. If the new encoding is a [=UTF-16 encoding=], then change it to [=UTF-8=].
  3. If the new encoding is the [=x-user-defined=] encoding, then change it to [=windows-1252=].
      [[!ENCODING]]
  4. If the new encoding is identical or equivalent to the encoding that is already being used to
      interpret the input stream, then set the [=confidence=] to *certain* and abort these steps.
      This happens when the encoding information found in the file matches what the
      [=encoding sniffing algorithm=] determined to be the encoding, and in the second pass through
      the parser if the first pass found that the [=encoding sniffing algorithm=] described in the
      earlier section failed to find the right encoding.
  5. If all the bytes up to the last byte converted by the current decoder have the same Unicode
      interpretations in both the current encoding and the new encoding, and if the user agent
      supports changing the converter on the fly, then the user agent may change to the new
      converter for the encoding on the fly. Set the [=document's character encoding=] and the
      encoding used to convert the input stream to the new encoding, set the [=confidence=] to
      *certain*, and abort these steps.
  6. Otherwise, [=navigate=] to the document again, with [=replacement enabled=], and using the same
      [=source browsing context=], but this time skip the [=encoding sniffing algorithm=] and
      instead just set the encoding to the new encoding and the [=confidence=] to *certain*.
      Whenever possible, this should be done without actually contacting the network layer (the
      bytes should be re-parsed from memory), even if, e.g., the document is marked as not being
      cacheable. If this is not possible and contacting the network layer would involve repeating a
      request that uses a method other than `GET`), then instead set the [=confidence=] to *certain*
      and ignore the new encoding. The resource will be misinterpreted. User agents may notify the
      user of the situation, to aid in application development.

  <p class="note">This algorithm is only invoked when a new encoding is found declared on a <{meta}>
  element.</p>

#### Preprocessing the input stream #### {#preprocessing-the-input-stream}

  The <dfn>input stream</dfn> consists of the characters pushed into it as the [=input byte stream=]
  is decoded or from the various APIs that directly manipulate the input stream.

  Any occurrences of any characters in the ranges U+0001 to U+0008, U+000E to U+001F, U+007F to
  U+009F, U+FDD0 to U+FDEF, and characters U+000B, U+FFFE, U+FFFF, U+1FFFE, U+1FFFF, U+2FFFE,
  U+2FFFF, U+3FFFE, U+3FFFF, U+4FFFE, U+4FFFF, U+5FFFE, U+5FFFF, U+6FFFE, U+6FFFF, U+7FFFE, U+7FFFF,
  U+8FFFE, U+8FFFF, U+9FFFE, U+9FFFF, U+AFFFE, U+AFFFF, U+BFFFE, U+BFFFF, U+CFFFE, U+CFFFF, U+DFFFE,
  U+DFFFF, U+EFFFE, U+EFFFF, U+FFFFE, U+FFFFF, U+10FFFE, and U+10FFFF are [=parse errors=]. These
  are all [=control characters=] or permanently undefined Unicode characters (noncharacters).

  Any [=character=] that is a not a [=Unicode character=], i.e., any isolated surrogate, is a
  [=parse error=]. (These can only find their way into the input stream via script APIs such as
  {{Document/write()|document.write()}}.)

  U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters and U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters are treated specially.
  Any LF character that immediately follows a CR character must be ignored, and all CR characters
  must then be converted to LF characters. Thus, newlines in HTML DOMs are represented by LF
  characters, and there are never any CR characters in the input to the
  [[#tokenization|tokenization]] stage.

  The <dfn>next input character</dfn> is the first character in the [=input stream=] that has not
  yet been <dfn>consumed</dfn> or explicitly ignored by the requirements in this section. Initially,
  the [=next input character=] is the first character in the input. The
  <dfn>current input character</dfn> is the last character to have been *consumed*.

  The <dfn>insertion point</dfn> is the position (just before a character or just before the end of
  the input stream) where content inserted using {{Document/write()|document.write()}} is actually
  inserted. The insertion point is relative to the position of the character immediately after it,
  it is not an absolute offset into the input stream. Initially, the insertion point is undefined.

  The "EOF" character in the tables below is a conceptual character representing the end of the
  [=input stream=]. If the parser is a [=script-created parser=], then the end of the
  [=input stream=] is reached when an <dfn>explicit "EOF" character</dfn> (inserted by the
  {{Document/close()|document.close()}} method) is consumed. Otherwise, the "EOF" character is not a
  real character in the stream, but rather the lack of any further characters.

  <p class="note">The handling of U+0000 NULL characters varies based on where the characters are
  found. In general, they are ignored, but for security reasons they are sometimes replaced with
  U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER. This can happen in tokenization or tree construction.</p>

### Parse state ### {#parse-state}

#### The insertion mode #### {#the-insertion-mode}

  The <dfn>insertion mode</dfn> is a state variable that controls the primary operation of the tree
  construction stage.

  Initially, the [=insertion mode=] is "[=initial=]". It can change to "[=before html=]",
  "[=before head=]", "[=in head=]", "[=in head noscript=]", "[=after head=]", "[=in body=]",
  "[=in text|text=]", "[=in table=]", "[=in table text=]", "[=in caption=]", "[=in column group=]",
  "[=in table body=]", "[=in row=]", "[=in cell=]", "[=in select=]", "[=in select in table=]",
  "[=in template=]", "[=after body=]", "[=in frameset=]", "[=after frameset=]",
  "[=after after body=]", and "[=after after frameset=]" during the course of the parsing, as
  described in the tree construction stage. The insertion mode affects how tokens are processed and
  whether CDATA sections are supported.

  Several of these modes, namely "[=in head=]", "[=in body=]", "[=in table=]", and "[=in select=]",
  are special, in that the other modes defer to them at various times. When the algorithm below says
  that the user agent is to do something "<dfn>using the rules for</dfn> the |m| insertion mode",
  where |m| is one of these modes, the user agent must use the rules described under the |m|
  [=insertion mode=]'s section, but must leave the [=insertion mode=] unchanged unless the rules in
  |m| themselves switch the [=insertion mode=] to a new value.

  When the insertion mode is switched to "[=in text|text=]" or "[=in table text=]", the
  <dfn>original insertion mode</dfn> is also set. This is the insertion mode to which the tree
  construction stage will return.

  Similarly, to parse nested <{template}> elements, a <dfn>stack of template insertion modes</dfn>
  is used. It is initially empty. The <dfn>current template insertion mode</dfn> is the insertion
  mode that was most recently added to the [=stack of template insertion modes=]. The algorithms in
  the sections below will *push* insertion modes onto this stack, meaning that the specified
  insertion mode is to be added to the stack, and *pop* insertion modes from the stack, which means
  that the most recently added insertion mode must be removed from the stack.

  ---

  When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>reset the insertion mode appropriately</dfn>, it means
  the UA must follow these steps:

  1. Let |last| be false.
  2. Let |node| be the last node in the [=stack of open elements=].
  3. |Loop|: If |node| is the first node in the stack of open elements, then set |last| to true,
      and, if the parser was originally created as part of the [=HTML fragment parsing algorithm=]
      ([=fragment case=]), set |node| to the [=context=] element passed to that algorithm.
  4. If |node| is a <{select}> element, run these substeps:
      1. If |last| is true, jump to the step below labeled |Done|.
      2. Let |ancestor| be |node|.
      3. |Loop|: If |ancestor| is the first node in the [=stack of open elements=], jump to the step
          below labeled |Done|.
      4. Let |ancestor| be the node before |ancestor| in the [=stack of open elements=].
      5. If |ancestor| is a <{template}> node, jump to the step below labeled |Done|.
      6. If |ancestor| is a <{table}> node, switch the [=insertion mode=] to
          "[=in select in table=]" and abort these steps.
      7. Jump back to the step labeled |Loop|.
      8. |Done|: Switch the [=insertion mode=] to "[=in select=]" and abort these steps.
  5. If |node| is a <{td}> or <{th}> element and |last| is false, then switch the [=insertion mode=]
      to "[=in cell=]" and abort these steps.
  6. If |node| is a <{tr}> element, then switch the [=insertion mode=] to "[=in row=]" and abort
      these steps.
  7. If |node| is a <{tbody}>, <{thead}>, or <{tfoot}> element, then switch the [=insertion mode=]
      to "[=in table body=]" and abort these steps.
  8. If |node| is a <{caption}> element, then switch the [=insertion mode=] to "[=in caption=]" and
      abort these steps.
  9. If |node| is a <{colgroup}> element, then switch the [=insertion mode=] to
      "[=in column group=]" and abort these steps.
  10. If |node| is a <{table}> element, then switch the [=insertion mode=] to "[=in table=]" and
      abort these steps.
  11. If |node| is a <{template}> element, then switch the [=insertion mode=] to the
      [=current template insertion mode=] and abort these steps.
  12. If |node| is a <{head}> element and |last| is false, then switch the [=insertion mode=] to
      "[=in head=]" and abort these steps.
  13. If |node| is a <{body}> element, then switch the [=insertion mode=] to "[=in body=]" and abort
      these steps.
  14. If |node| is a <{frameset}> element, then switch the [=insertion mode=] to "[=in frameset=]"
      and abort these steps. ([=fragment case=])
  15. If |node| is an <{html}> element, run these substeps:
      1. If the <a>`head` element pointer</a> is null, switch the [=insertion mode=] to
          "[=before head=]" and abort these steps. ([=fragment case=])
      2. Otherwise, the <a>`head` element pointer</a> is not null, switch the [=insertion mode=] to
          "[=after head=]" and abort these steps.
  16. If |last| is true, then switch the [=insertion mode=] to "[=in body=]" and abort these steps.
      ([=fragment case=])
  17. Let |node| now be the node before |node| in the [=stack of open elements=].
  18. Return to the step labeled |Loop|.

#### The stack of open elements #### {#the-stack-of-open-elements}

  Initially, the <dfn>stack of open elements</dfn> is empty. The stack grows downwards; the topmost
  node on the stack is the first one added to the stack, and the bottommost node of the stack is the
  most recently added node in the stack (notwithstanding when the stack is manipulated in a random
  access fashion as part of [=adoption agency algorithm|the handling for misnested tags=]).

  <p class="note">The "[=before html=]" [=insertion mode=] creates the <{html}>
  [=document element=], which is then added to the stack.</p>

  <p class="note">In the [=fragment case=], the [=stack of open elements=] is initialized to contain
  an <{html}> element that is created as part of [=HTML fragment parsing algorithm|that algorithm=].
  (The [=fragment case=] skips the "[=before html=]" [=insertion mode=].)</p>

  The <{html}> node, however it is created, is the topmost node of the stack. It only gets popped
  off the stack when the parser [=stop parsing|finishes=].

  The <dfn>current node</dfn> is the bottommost node in this [=stack of open elements=].

  The <dfn>adjusted current node</dfn> is the [=context=] element if the parser was created by the
  [=HTML fragment parsing algorithm=] and the [=stack of open elements=] has only one element in it
  ([=fragment case=]); otherwise, the [=adjusted current node=] is the [=current node=].

  Elements in the [=stack of open elements=] fall into the following categories:

  : <dfn>Special</dfn>
  :: The following elements have varying levels of special parsing rules: HTML's <{address}>,
      <{applet}>, <{area}>, <{article}>, <{aside}>, <{base}>, <{basefont}>, <{bgsound}>,
      <{blockquote}>, <{body}>, <{br}>, <{button}>, <{caption}>, <{center}>, <{col}>, <{colgroup}>,
      <{dd}>, <{details}>, <{dir}>, <{div}>, <{dl}>, <{dt}>, <{embed}>, <{fieldset}>,
      <{figcaption}>, <{figure}>, <{footer}>, <{form}>, <{frame}>, <{frameset}>, <{h1}>, <{h2}>,
      <{h3}>, <{h4}>, <{h5}>, <{h6}>, <{head}>, <{header}>, <{hr}>, <{html}>, <{iframe}>, <{img}>,
      <{input}>, <{li}>, <{link}>, <{listing}>, <{main}>, <{marquee}>, <{meta}>, <{nav}>,
      <{noembed}>, <{noframes}>, <{noscript}>, <{object}>, <{ol}>, <{p}>, <{param}>, <{plaintext}>,
      <{pre}>, <{script}>, <{section}>, <{select}>, <{source}>, <{style}>, <{summary}>, <{table}>,
      <{tbody}>, <{td}>, <{template}>, <{textarea}>, <{tfoot}>, <{th}>, <{thead}>, <{title}>,
      <{tr}>, <{track}>, <{ul}>, <{wbr}>, <{xmp}>; MathML <{mi}>, MathML <{mo}>, MathML <{mn}>,
      MathML <{ms}>, MathML <{mtext}>, and MathML <{annotation-xml}>; and SVG <{foreignObject}>,
      SVG <{desc}>, and SVG <a element for="svg"><code>title</code></a>.

      <p class="note">An `image` start tag token is handled by the tree builder, but it is not in
      this list because it is not an element; it gets turned into an <{img}> element.</p>

  : <dfn>Formatting</dfn>
  :: The following HTML elements are those that end up in the
      [=list of active formatting elements=]: <{a}>, <{b}>, <{big}>, <{code}>, <{em}>, <{font}>,
      <{i}>, <{nobr}>, <{s}>, <{small}>, <{strike}>, <{strong}>, <{tt}>, and <{u}>.

  : <dfn>Ordinary</dfn>
  :: All other elements found while parsing an HTML document.

  <p class="note">Typically, the [=special=] elements have the start and end tag tokens handled
  specifically, while [=ordinary=] elements' tokens fall into "any other start tag" and "any other
  end tag" clauses, and some parts of the tree builder check if a particular element in the
  [=stack of open elements=] is in the [=special=] category. However, some elements (e.g., the
  <{option}> element) have their start or end tag tokens handled specifically, but are still not in
  the [=special=] category, so that they get the [=ordinary=] handling elsewhere.</p>

  The [=stack of open elements=] is said to
  <dfn lt="has that element in the specific scope">have an element |target node| in a specific scope</dfn>
  consisting of a list of element types |list| when the following algorithm terminates in a match
  state:

  1. Initialize |node| to be the [=current node=] (the bottommost node of the stack).
  2. If |node| is the target node, terminate in a match state.
  3. Otherwise, if |node| is one of the element types in |list|, terminate in a failure state.
  4. Otherwise, set |node| to the previous entry in the [=stack of open elements=] and return to
      step 2. (This will never fail, since the loop will always terminate in the previous step if
      the top of the stack — an <{html}> element — is reached.)

  The [=stack of open elements=] is said to
  <dfn lt="in scope">have a particular element in scope</dfn> when it
  [=has that element in the specific scope=] consisting of the following element types:

  <ul class="brief">
    * <{applet}>
    * <{caption}>
    * <{html}>
    * <{table}>
    * <{td}>
    * <{th}>
    * <{marquee}>
    * <{object}>
    * <{template}>
    * MathML <{mi}>
    * MathML <{mo}>
    * MathML <{mn}>
    * MathML <{ms}>
    * MathML <{mtext}>
    * MathML <{annotation-xml}>
    * SVG <{foreignObject}>
    * SVG <{desc}>
    * SVG <a element for="svg"><code>title</code></a>
  </ul>

  The [=stack of open elements=] is said to
  <dfn lt="have an li element in list item scope">have a particular element in list item scope</dfn>
  when it [=has that element in the specific scope=] consisting of the following element types:

  <ul class="brief">
    * All the element types listed above for the [=in scope|has an element in scope=] algorithm.
    * <{ol}> in the [=HTML namespace=]
    * <{ul}> in the [=HTML namespace=]
  </ul>

  The [=stack of open elements=] is said to
  <dfn lt="has a p element in button scope">have a particular element in button scope</dfn> when it
  [=has that element in the specific scope=] consisting of the following element types:

  <ul class="brief">
    * All the element types listed above for the [=in scope|has an element in scope=] algorithm.
    * <{button}> in the [=HTML namespace=]
  </ul>

  The [=stack of open elements=] is said to
  <dfn lt="in table scope">have a particular element in table scope</dfn> when it
  [=has that element in the specific scope=] consisting of the following element types:

  <ul class="brief">
    * <{html}> in the [=HTML namespace=]
    * <{table}> in the [=HTML namespace=]
    * <{template}> in the [=HTML namespace=]
  </ul>

  The [=stack of open elements=] is said to
  <dfn lt="have a select element in select scope">have a particular element in select scope</dfn>
  when it [=has that element in the specific scope=] consisting of all element types *except* the
  following:

  <ul class="brief">
    * <{optgroup}> in the [=HTML namespace=]
    * <{option}> in the [=HTML namespace=]
  </ul>

  Nothing happens if at any time any of the elements in the [=stack of open elements=] are moved to
  a new location in, or removed from, the {{Document}} tree. In particular, the stack is not changed
  in this situation. This can cause, amongst other strange effects, content to be appended to nodes
  that are no longer in the DOM.

  <p class="note">In some cases (namely, when
  [=adoption agency algorithm|closing misnested formatting elements=]), the stack is manipulated in
  a random-access fashion.</p>

#### The list of active formatting elements #### {#the-list-of-active-formatting-elements}

  Initially, the <dfn>list of active formatting elements</dfn> is empty. It is used to handle
  mis-nested [=formatting|formatting element tags=].

  The list contains elements in the [=formatting=] category, and [=markers=]. The <dfn>markers</dfn>
  are inserted when entering <{applet}>, <{object}>, <{marquee}>, <{template}>, <{td}>, <{th}>, and
  <{caption}> elements, and are used to prevent formatting from "leaking" into <{applet}>,
  <{object}>, <{marquee}>, <{template}>, <{td}>, <{th}>, and <{caption}> elements.

  In addition, each element in the [=list of active formatting elements=] is associated with the
  token for which it was created, so that further elements can be created for that token if
  necessary.

  When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>push onto the list of active formatting elements</dfn>
  an element |element|, the UA must perform the following steps:

  1. If there are already three elements in the [=list of active formatting elements=] after the
      last [=marker=], if any, or anywhere in the list if there are no [=markers=], that have the
      same tag name, namespace, and attributes as |element|, then remove the earliest such element
      from the [=list of active formatting elements=]. For these purposes, the attributes must be
      compared as they were when the elements were created by the parser; two elements have the same
      attributes if all their parsed attributes can be paired such that the two attributes in each
      pair have identical names, namespaces, and values (the order of the attributes does not
      matter).

      <p class="note">This is the Noah's Ark clause. But with three per family instead of two.</p>
  2. Add |element| to the [=list of active formatting elements=].

  When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>reconstruct the active formatting elements</dfn>, the
  UA must perform the following steps:

  1. If there are no entries in the [=list of active formatting elements=], then there is nothing to
      reconstruct; stop this algorithm.
  2. If the last (most recently added) entry in the [=list of active formatting elements=] is a
      [=marker=], or if it is an element that is in the [=stack of open elements=], then there is
      nothing to reconstruct; stop this algorithm.
  3. Let |entry| be the last (most recently added) element in the
      [=list of active formatting elements=].
  4. |Rewind|: If there are no entries before |entry| in the [=list of active formatting elements=],
      then jump to the step labeled |Create|.
  5. Let |entry| be the entry one earlier than |entry| in the
      [=list of active formatting elements=].
  6. If |entry| is neither a [=marker=] nor an element that is also in the
      [=stack of open elements=], go to the step labeled |Rewind|.
  7. |Advance|: Let |entry| be the element one later than |entry| in the
      [=list of active formatting elements=].
  8. |Create|: [=Insert an HTML element=] for the token for which the element |entry| was created,
      to obtain |new element|.
  9. Replace the entry for |entry| in the list with an entry for |new element|.
  10. If the entry for |new element| in the [=list of active formatting elements=] is not the last
      entry in the list, return to the step labeled |Advance|.

  This has the effect of reopening all the formatting elements that were opened in the current body,
  cell, or caption (whichever is youngest) that haven't been explicitly closed.

  <p class="note">The way this specification is written, the [=list of active formatting elements=]
  always consists of elements in chronological order with the least recently added element first and
  the most recently added element last (except for while steps 7 to 10 of the above algorithm are
  being executed, of course).</p>

  When the steps below require the UA to
  <dfn>clear the list of active formatting elements up to the last marker</dfn>, the UA must perform
  the following steps:

  1. Let |entry| be the last (most recently added) entry in the
      [=list of active formatting elements=].
  2. Remove |entry| from the [=list of active formatting elements=].
  3. If |entry| was a [=marker=], then stop the algorithm at this point. The list has been cleared
      up to the last [=marker=].
  4. Go to step 1.

#### The element pointers #### {#the-element-pointers}

  Initially, the <dfn><{head}> element pointer</dfn> and the <dfn><{form}> element pointer</dfn> are
  both null.

  Once a <{head}> element has been parsed (whether implicitly or explicitly) the
  <a>`head` element pointer</a> gets set to point to this node.

  The <a>`form` element pointer</a> points to the last <{form}> element that was opened and whose end
  tag has not yet been seen. It is used to make form controls associate with forms in the face of
  dramatically bad markup, for historical reasons. It is ignored inside <{template}> elements.

#### Other parsing state flags #### {#other-parsing-state-flags}

  The <dfn>scripting flag</dfn> is set to "enabled" if [=scripting was enabled=] for the
  {{Document}} with which the parser is associated when the parser was created, and "disabled"
  otherwise.

  <p class="note">The [=scripting flag=] can be enabled even when the parser was originally created
  for the [=HTML fragment parsing algorithm=], even though <{script}> elements don't execute in that
  case.</p>

  The <dfn>frameset-ok flag</dfn> is set to "ok" when the parser is created. It is set to "not ok"
  after certain tokens are seen.

### Tokenization ### {#tokenization}

  Implementations must act as if they used the following state machine to tokenize HTML. The state
  machine must start in the [=data state=]. Most states consume a single character, which may have
  various side-effects, and either switches the state machine to a new state to [=reconsume=] the
  [=current input character=], or switches it to a new state to consume the next character, or stays
  in the same state to consume the next character. Some states have more complicated behavior and
  can consume several characters before switching to another state. In some cases, the tokenizer
  state is also changed by the tree construction stage.

  When a state says to <dfn>reconsume</dfn> a matched character in a specified state, that means to
  switch to that state, but when it attempts to consume the [=next input character=], provide it
  with the [=current input character=] instead.

  The exact behavior of certain states depends on the [=insertion mode=] and the
  [=stack of open elements=]. Certain states also use a <dfn>|temporary buffer|</dfn> to track
  progress, and the [=character reference state=] uses a <dfn>return state</dfn> to return to the
  state it was invoked from.

  The output of the tokenization step is a series of zero or more of the following tokens: DOCTYPE,
  start tag, end tag, comment, character, end-of-file. DOCTYPE tokens have a name, a public
  identifier, a system identifier, and a <dfn>force-quirks flag</dfn>. When a DOCTYPE token is
  created, its name, public identifier, and system identifier must be marked as missing (which is a
  distinct state from the empty string), and the [=force-quirks flag=] must be set to *off* (its
  other state is *on*). Start and end tag tokens have a tag name, a <dfn>self-closing flag</dfn>,
  and a list of attributes, each of which has a name and a value. When a start or end tag token is
  created, its [=self-closing flag=] must be unset (its other state is that it be set), and its
  attributes list must be empty. Comment and character tokens have data.

  When a token is emitted, it must immediately be handled by the tree construction stage. The tree
  construction stage can affect the state of the tokenization stage, and can insert additional
  characters into the stream. (For example, the <{script}> element can result in scripts executing
  and using the [=dynamic markup insertion=] APIs to insert characters into the stream being
  tokenized.)

  <p class="note">Creating a token and emitting it are distinct actions. It is possible for a token
  to be created but implicitly abandoned (never emitted), e.g., if the file ends unexpectedly while
  processing the characters that are being parsed into a start tag token.</p>

  When a start tag token is emitted with its [=self-closing flag=] set, if the flag is not
  <dfn>acknowledged</dfn> when it is processed by the tree construction stage, that is a
  [=parse error=].

  When an end tag token is emitted with attributes, that is a [=parse error=].

  When an end tag token is emitted with its [=self-closing flag=] set, that is a [=parse error=].

  An <dfn>appropriate end tag token</dfn> is an end tag token whose tag name matches the tag name of
  the last start tag to have been emitted from this tokenizer, if any. If no start tag has been
  emitted from this tokenizer, then no end tag token is appropriate.

  Before each step of the tokenizer, the user agent must first check the [=parser pause flag=]. If
  it is true, then the tokenizer must abort the processing of any nested invocations of the
  tokenizer, yielding control back to the caller.

  The tokenizer state machine consists of the states defined in the following subsections.

#### <dfn id="tokenizer-data-state">Data state</dfn> #### {#data-state}

  <dl class="switch">

  When the user agent leaves the attribute name state (and before emitting the tag token, if
  appropriate), the complete attribute's name must be compared to the other attributes on the same
  token; if there is already an attribute on the token with the exact same name, then this is a
  [=parse error=] and the new attribute must be removed from the token.

  <p class="note">If an attribute is so removed from a token, it, and the value that gets associated
  with it, if any, are never subsequently used by the parser, and are therefore effectively
  discarded. Removing the attribute in this way does not change its status as the "current
  attribute" for the purposes of the tokenizer, however.</p>

  0xFDEF, or is one of 0x000B, 0xFFFE, 0xFFFF, 0x1FFFE, 0x1FFFF, 0x2FFFE, 0x2FFFF, 0x3FFFE, 0x3FFFF,
  0x4FFFE, 0x4FFFF, 0x5FFFE, 0x5FFFF, 0x6FFFE, 0x6FFFF, 0x7FFFE, 0x7FFFF, 0x8FFFE, 0x8FFFF, 0x9FFFE,
  0x9FFFF, 0xAFFFE, 0xAFFFF, 0xBFFFE, 0xBFFFF, 0xCFFFE, 0xCFFFF, 0xDFFFE, 0xDFFFF, 0xEFFFE, 0xEFFFF,
  0xFFFFE, 0xFFFFF, 0x10FFFE, or 0x10FFFF, then this is a [=parse error=].

  Set the [=temporary buffer=] to the empty string. Append the Unicode character with code point
  equal to the [=character reference code=] to the [=temporary buffer=]. Switch to the
  [=character reference end state=].

#### <dfn id="tokenizer-character-reference-end-state">Character reference end state</dfn> #### {#character-reference-end-state}

  Consume the [=next input character=].

  Check the [=return state=]:

  <dl class="switch">
    : [=attribute value (double-quoted) state=]
    : [=attribute value (single-quoted) state=]
    : [=attribute value (unquoted) state=]
    :: Append each character in the [=temporary buffer=] (in the order they were added to the
        buffer) to the current attribute's value.

    : Anything else
    :: For each of the characters in the [=temporary buffer=] (in the order they were added to the
        buffer), emit the character as a character token.
  </dl>

  [=Reconsume=] in the [=return state=].

### Tree construction ### {#tree-construction}

  The input to the tree construction stage is a sequence of tokens from the
  [[#tokenization|tokenization]] stage. The tree construction stage is associated with a DOM
  {{Document}} object when a parser is created. The "output" of this stage consists of dynamically
  modifying or extending that document's DOM tree.

  This specification does not define when an interactive user agent has to render the {{Document}}
  so that it is available to the user, or when it has to begin accepting user input.

  ---

  As each token is emitted from the tokenizer, the user agent must follow the appropriate steps from
  the following list, known as the <dfn>tree construction dispatcher</dfn>:

  <dl class="switch">
    : If the [=stack of open elements=] is empty
    : If the [=adjusted current node=] is an element in the [=HTML namespace=]
    : If the [=adjusted current node=] is a [=MathML text integration point=] and the token is a
        start tag whose tag name is neither "mglyph" nor "malignmark"
    : If the [=adjusted current node=] is a [=MathML text integration point=] and the token is a
        character token
    : If the [=adjusted current node=] is a MathML <{annotation-xml}> element and the token is a
        start tag whose tag name is "svg"
    : If the [=adjusted current node=] is an [=HTML integration point=] and the token is a start tag
    : If the [=adjusted current node=] is an [=HTML integration point=] and the token is a character
        token
    : If the token is an end-of-file token
    :: Process the token according to the rules given in the section corresponding to the current
        [=insertion mode=] in HTML content.

    : Otherwise
    :: Process the token according to the rules given in the section for parsing tokens
        [=in foreign content=].
  </dl>

  The <dfn>next token</dfn> is the token that is about to be processed by the
  [=tree construction dispatcher=] (even if the token is subsequently just ignored).

  A node is a <dfn>MathML text integration point</dfn> if it is one of the following elements:

  <ul class="brief">
    * A MathML <{mi}> element
    * A MathML <{mo}> element
    * A MathML <{mn}> element
    * A MathML <{ms}> element
    * A MathML <{mtext}> element
  </ul>

  A node is an <dfn>HTML integration point</dfn> if it is one of the following elements:

  <ul class="brief">
    * A MathML <{annotation-xml}> element whose start tag token had an attribute with the name
        "encoding" whose value was an [=ASCII case-insensitive=] match for the string
        "<code>[[#text-html|text/html]]</code>"<!-- BIKESHED: back-tick can't handle complicated contents [yet] -->
    * A MathML <{annotation-xml}> element whose start tag token had an attribute with the name
        "encoding" whose value was an [=ASCII case-insensitive=] match for the string
        "`application/xhtml+xml`"
    * An SVG <{foreignObject}> element
    * An SVG <{desc}> element
    * An SVG <a element for="svg"><code>title</code></a> element
  </ul>

  <p class="note">If the node in question is the [=context=] element passed to the
  [=HTML fragment parsing algorithm=], then the start tag token for that element is the "fake" token
  created during by that [=HTML fragment parsing algorithm=].</p>

  ---

  <p class="note">Not all of the tag names mentioned below are conformant tag names in this
  specification; many are included to handle legacy content. They still form part of the algorithm
  that implementations are required to implement to claim conformance.</p>

  <p class="note">The algorithm described below places no limit on the depth of the DOM tree
  generated, or on the length of tag names, attribute names, attribute values, {{Text}} nodes, etc.
  While implementors are encouraged to avoid arbitrary limits, it is recognized that
  [=practical concerns=] will likely force user agents to impose nesting depth constraints.</p>

#### Creating and inserting nodes #### {#creating-and-inserting-nodes}

  While the parser is processing a token, it can enable or disable <dfn>foster parenting</dfn>. This
  affects the following algorithm.

  The <dfn>appropriate place for inserting a node</dfn>, optionally using a particular
  |override target|, is the position in an element returned by running the following steps:

  1. If there was an |override target| specified, then let |target| be the |override target|.

      Otherwise, let |target| be the [=current node=].
  2. Determine the |adjusted insertion location| using the first matching steps from the following
      list:

      <dl class="switch">
        : If [=foster parenting=] is enabled and |target| is a <{table}>, <{tbody}>, <{tfoot}>,
            <{thead}>, or <{tr}> element
        :: <p class="note">Foster parenting happens when content is misnested in tables.</p>

            Run these substeps:

            1. Let |last template| be the last <{template}> element in the
                [=stack of open elements=], if any.
            2. Let |last table| be the last <{table}> element in the [=stack of open elements=], if
                any.
            3. If there is a |last template| and either there is no |last table|, or there is one,
                but |last template| is lower (more recently added) than |last table| in the
                [=stack of open elements=], then: let |adjusted insertion location| be inside
                |last template|'s [=template contents=], after its last child (if any), and abort
                these substeps.
            4. If there is no |last table|, then let |adjusted insertion location| be inside the
                first element in the [=stack of open elements=] (the <{html}> element), after its
                last child (if any), and abort these substeps. ([=fragment case=])
            5. If |last table| has a parent node, then let |adjusted insertion location| be inside
                |last table|'s parent node, immediately before |last table|, and abort these
                substeps.
            6. Let |previous element| be the element immediately above |last table| in the
                [=stack of open elements=].
            7. Let |adjusted insertion location| be inside |previous element|, after its last child
                (if any).

            <p class="note">These steps are involved in part because it's possible for elements, the
            <{table}> element in this case in particular, to have been moved by a script around in
            the DOM, or indeed removed from the DOM entirely, after the element was inserted by the
            parser.</p>

        : Otherwise
        :: Let |adjusted insertion location| be inside |target|, after its last child (if any).

      </dl>
  3. If the |adjusted insertion location| is inside a <{template}> element, let it instead be
      inside the <{template}> element's [=template contents=], after its last child (if any).
  4. Return the |adjusted insertion location|.

  ---

  When the steps below require the UA to
  <dfn lt="create an element for the token|create an element for a token">create an element for a token</dfn> in a particular
  |given namespace| and with a particular |intended parent|, the UA must run the following steps:

  1. Let |document| be |intended parent|'s [=node document=].
  2. Let |local name| be the tag name of the token.
  3. Let |is| be the value of the "`is`" attribute in the given token, if such an attribute exists,
      or null otherwise.
  4. Let |definition| be the result of [=looking up a custom element definition=] given |document|,
      |given namespace|, |local name|, and |is|.
  5. If |definition| is non-null and the parser was not originally created for the
      [=HTML fragment parsing algorithm=], then let |will execute script| be true. Otherwise, let it
      be false.
  6. If |will execute script| is true, then:
      1. Increment |document|'s [=throw-on-dynamic-markup-insertion counter=].
      2. If the [=JavaScript execution context stack=] is empty, then
          [=perform a microtask checkpoint=].
      3. Push a new [=element queue=] onto the [=custom element reactions stack=].
  7. Let |element| be the result of [=creating an element=] given |document|, |local name|,
      |given namespace|, null, and |is|. If |will execute script| is true, set the synchronous
      custom elements flag; otherwise, leave it unset.

      <p class="note">This will cause [=custom element constructors=] to run, if will execute script
      is true. However, since we incremented the [=throw-on-dynamic-markup-insertion counter=], this
      cannot cause {{Document/write()|new characters to be inserted into the tokenizer}}, or
      {{Document/open()|the document to be blown away}}.</p>

      If this step throws an exception, then <a>report the exception</a>,
      and let <var>element</var> be instead a new element that implements {{HTMLUnknownElement}},
      with no attributes, namespace set to <var>given namespace</var>, namespace prefix set to null,
      <a>custom element state</a> set to "<code>failed</code>", <a>custom element definition</a>
      set to null, and <a>node document</a> set to <var>document</var>.
      
  8. [=Append=] each attribute in the given token to |element|.

      <p class="note">This can [=enqueue a custom element callback reaction=] for the
      `attributeChangedCallback`, which might run immediately (in the next step).</p>

      <p class="note">Even though the `is` attribute governs the [=create an element|creation=] of a
      [=customized built-in element=], it is not present during the execution of the relevant
      [=custom element constructor=]; it is appended in this step, along with all other
      attributes.</p>
  9. If |will execute script| is true, then:
      1. Let |queue| be the result of popping the [=current element queue=] from the
          [=custom element reactions stack=]. (This will be the same [=element queue=] as was pushed
          above.)
      2. [=Invoke custom element reactions=] in |queue|.
      3. Decrement |document|'s [=throw-on-dynamic-markup-insertion counter=].
  10. If |element| has an <{xmlns/xmlns}> attribute *in the [=XMLNS namespace=]* whose value is not
      exactly the same as the element's namespace, that is a [=parse error=]. Similarly, if
      |element| has an <{xlink/xlink|xmlns:xlink}> attribute in the [=XMLNS namespace=] whose value
      is not the [=XLink namespace=], that is a [=parse error=].
  11. If |element| is a [=resettable element=], invoke its [=reset algorithm=]. (This initializes
      the element's [=forms/value=] and [=forms/checkedness=] based on the element's attributes.)
  12. If |element| is a [=form-associated element=], and the <a>`form` element pointer</a> is not null,
      and there is no <{template}> element on the [=stack of open elements=], and |element| is
      either not [=listed elements|listed=] or doesn't have a <{formelements/form}> attribute, and
      the |intended parent| is in the same [=tree=] as the element pointed to by the
      <a>`form` element pointer</a>, [=associate=] |element| with the <{form}> element pointed to by
      the <a>`form` element pointer</a>, and suppress the running of the [=reset the form owner=]
      algorithm when the parser subsequently attempts to insert the element.
  13. Return |element|.

  ---

  When the steps below require the user agent to <dfn>insert a foreign element</dfn> for a token in
  a given namespace, the user agent must run these steps:

  1. Let the |adjusted insertion location| be the [=appropriate place for inserting a node=].
  2. Let |element| be the result of
      [=create an element for the token|creating an element for the token=] in the given namespace,
      with the intended parent being the element in which the |adjusted insertion location| finds
      itself.
  3. If it is possible to insert |element| at the |adjusted insertion location|, then:
      1. Push a new [=element queue=] onto the [=custom element reactions stack=].
      2. Insert |element| at the |adjusted insertion location|.
      3. Pop the [=element queue=] from the [=custom element reactions stack=], and
          [=invoke custom element reactions=] in that queue.

      <p class="note">If the |adjusted insertion location| cannot accept more elements, e.g.,
      because it's a {{Document}} that already has an element child, then |element| is dropped on
      the floor.</p>
  4. Push |element| onto the [=stack of open elements=] so that it is the new [=current node=].
  5. Return |element|.

  When the steps below require the user agent to <dfn>insert an HTML element</dfn> for a token, the
  user agent must [=insert a foreign element=] for the token, in the [=HTML namespace=].

  ---

  When the steps below require the user agent to <dfn>adjust MathML attributes</dfn> for a token,
  then, if the token has an attribute named `definitionurl`, change its name to `definitionURL`
  (note the case difference).

  When the steps below require the user agent to <dfn>adjust SVG attributes</dfn> for a token, then,
  for each attribute on the token whose attribute name is one of the ones in the first column of the
  following table, change the attribute's name to the name given in the corresponding cell in the
  second column. (This fixes the case of SVG attributes that are not all lowercase.)

  When the steps below require the user agent to
  <dfn lt="insert a character|insert the character|insert the token's character">insert a character</dfn>
  while processing a token, the user agent must run the following steps:

  1. Let |data| be the characters passed to the algorithm, or, if no characters were explicitly
      specified, the character of the character token being processed.
  2. Let the |adjusted insertion location| be the [=appropriate place for inserting a node=].
  3. If the |adjusted insertion location| is in a {{Document}} node, then abort these steps.

      <p class="note">The DOM will not let {{Document}} nodes have {{Text}} node children, so the
      children are ignored.</p>
  4. If there is a {{Text}} node immediately before the |adjusted insertion location|, then append
      |data| to that {{Text}} node's data.

      Otherwise, create a new {{Text}} node whose data is |data| and whose [=node document=] is the
      same as that of the element in which the |adjusted insertion location| finds itself, and
      insert the newly created node at the |adjusted insertion location|.

  When the steps below require the user agent to <dfn>insert a comment</dfn> while processing a
  comment token, optionally with an explicitly insertion position |position|, the user agent must
  run the following steps:

  1. Let |data| be the data given in the comment token being processed.
  2. If |position| was specified, then let the |adjusted insertion location| be |position|.
      Otherwise, let |adjusted insertion location| be the
      [=appropriate place for inserting a node=].
  3. Create a {{Comment}} node whose {{CharacterData/data}} attribute is set to |data| and whose
      [=node document=] is the same as that of the node in which the |adjusted insertion location|
      finds itself.
  4. Insert the newly created node at the |adjusted insertion location|.

  DOM mutation events must not fire for changes caused by the UA parsing the document. This includes
  the parsing of any content inserted using {{Document/write()|document.write()}} and
  {{Document/writeln()|document.writeln()}} calls. [[!UIEVENTS]]

  However, [=mutation observers=] *do* fire, as required by the DOM specification.

#### Parsing elements that contain only text #### {#parsing-elements-that-contain-only-text}

  The <dfn>generic raw text element parsing algorithm</dfn> and the
  <dfn>generic RCDATA element parsing algorithm</dfn> consist of the following steps. These
  algorithms are always invoked in response to a start tag token.

  1. [=Insert an HTML element=] for the token.
  2. If the algorithm that was invoked is the [=generic raw text element parsing algorithm=], switch
      the tokenizer to the [=RAWTEXT state=]; otherwise the algorithm invoked was the
      [=generic RCDATA element parsing algorithm=], switch the tokenizer to the [=RCDATA state=].
  3. Let the [=original insertion mode=] be the current [=insertion mode=].
  4. Then, switch the [=insertion mode=] to "[=in text|text=]".

#### Closing elements that have implied end tags #### {#closing-elements-that-have-implied-end-tags}

  When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>generate implied end tags</dfn>, then, while the
  [=current node=] is a <{dd}> element, a <{dt}> element, an <{li}> element,
  an <{optgroup}> element, an <{option}> element, a <{p}> element, an <{rb}> element, an <{rp}>
  element, an <{rt}> element, or an <{rtc}> element, the UA must pop the [=current node=] off the
  [=stack of open elements=].

  If a step requires the UA to generate implied end tags but lists an element to exclude from the
  process, then the UA must perform the above steps as if that element was not in the above list.

  When the steps below require the UA to <dfn>generate all implied end tags thoroughly</dfn>, then,
  while the [=current node=] is a <{caption}> element, a <{colgroup}> element, a <{dd}> element, a
  <{dt}> element, an <{li}> element, an <{optgroup}> element, an <{option}> element, a <{p}>
  element, an <{rb}> element, an <{rp}> element, an <{rt}> element, an <{rtc}> element, a <{tbody}>
  element, a <{td}> element, a <{tfoot}> element, a <{th}> element, a <{thead}> element, or a <{tr}>
  element, the UA must pop the [=current node=] off the [=stack of open elements=].

#### The rules for parsing tokens in HTML content #### {#the-rules-for-parsing-tokens-in-html-content}

##### The "<dfn>initial</dfn>" insertion mode ##### {#the-initial-insertion-mode}

  When the user agent is to apply the rules for the "[=initial=]" [=insertion mode=], the user agent
  must handle the token as follows:

  <dl class="switch">
    : A character token that is one of U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION, U+000A LINE FEED (LF), U+000C
        FORM FEED (FF), U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR), or U+0020 SPACE
    :: Ignore the token.

    : A comment token
    :: [=Insert a comment=] as the last child of the {{Document}} object.

    : A DOCTYPE token
    :: If the DOCTYPE token's name is not a [=case-sensitive=] match for the string "`html`", or the
        token's public identifier is not missing, or the token's system identifier is neither
        missing nor a [=case-sensitive=] match for the string
        "<a scheme><code>about:legacy-compat</code></a>", then there is a [=parse error=].

        Append a {{DocumentType}} node to the {{Document}} node, with the {{DocumentType/name}}
        attribute set to the name given in the DOCTYPE token, or the empty string if the name was
        missing; the {{DocumentType/publicId}} attribute set to the public identifier given in the
        DOCTYPE token, or the empty string if the public identifier was missing; the
        {{DocumentType/systemId}} attribute set to the system identifier given in the DOCTYPE token,
        or the empty string if the system identifier was missing; and the other attributes specific
        to {{DocumentType}} objects set to null and empty lists as appropriate. Associate the
        {{DocumentType}} node with the {{Document}} object so that it is returned as the value of
        the {{Document/doctype}} attribute of the {{Document}} object.

        Then, if the document is *not* <a>an `iframe` `srcdoc` document</a>, and the DOCTYPE token
        matches one of the conditions in the following list, then set the {{Document}} to
        [=quirks mode=]:

  </dl>

  When the steps above say the UA is to <dfn>close a <{p}> element</dfn>, it means that the UA must
  run the following steps:

  1. [=Generate implied end tags=], except for <{p}> elements.
  2. If the [=current node=] is not a <{p}> element, then this is a [=parse error=].
  3. Pop elements from the [=stack of open elements=] until a <{p}> element has been popped from the
      stack.

  The <dfn>adoption agency algorithm</dfn>, which takes as its only argument a token |token| for
  which the algorithm is being run, consists of the following steps:

  1. Let |subject| be |token|'s tag name.
  2. If the [=current node=] is an [=HTML element=] whose tag name is |subject|, and the
      [=current node=] is not in the [=list of active formatting elements=], then pop the
      [=current node=] off the [=stack of open elements=], and abort these steps.
  3. Let |outer loop counter| be zero.
  4. |Outer loop|: If |outer loop counter| is greater than or equal to eight, then abort these
      steps.
  5. Increment |outer loop counter| by one.
  6. Let |formatting element| be the last element in the [=list of active formatting elements=]
      that:

      * is between the end of the list and the last [=marker=] in the list, if any, or the start of
          the list otherwise, and
      * has the tag name |subject|.

      If there is no such element, then abort these steps and instead act as described in the "any
      other end tag" entry above.
  7. If |formatting element| is not in the [=stack of open elements=], then this is a
      [=parse error=]; remove the element from the list, and abort these steps.
  8. If |formatting element| is in the [=stack of open elements=], but the element is not
      [=in scope=], then this is a [=parse error=]; abort these steps.
  9. If |formatting element| is not the [=current node=], this is a [=parse error=]. (But do not
      abort these steps.)
  10. Let |furthest block| be the topmost node in the [=stack of open elements=] that is lower in
      the stack than |formatting element|, and is an element in the [=special=] category. There
      might not be one.
  11. If there is no |furthest block|, then the UA must first pop all the nodes from the bottom of
      the [=stack of open elements=], from the [=current node=] up to and including
      |formatting element|, then remove |formatting element| from the
      [=list of active formatting elements=], and finally abort these steps.
  12. Let |common ancestor| be the element immediately above |formatting element| in the
      [=stack of open elements=].
  13. Let a bookmark note the position of |formatting element| in the
      [=list of active formatting elements=] relative to the elements on either side of it in the
      list.
  14. Let |node| and |last node| be |furthest block|. Follow these steps:

      1. Let |inner loop counter| be zero.
      2. |Inner loop|: Increment |inner loop counter| by one.
      3. Let |node| be the element immediately above |node| in the [=stack of open elements=], or
          if |node| is no longer in the [=stack of open elements=] (e.g., because it got removed by
          this algorithm), the element that was immediately above |node| in the
          [=stack of open elements=] before |node| was removed.
      4. If |node| is |formatting element|, then go to the next step in the overall algorithm.
      5. If |inner loop counter| is greater than three and |node| is in the
          [=list of active formatting elements=], then remove |node| from the
          [=list of active formatting elements=].
      6. If |node| is not in the [=list of active formatting elements=], then remove |node| from the
          [=stack of open elements=] and then go back to the step labeled |Inner loop|.
      7. [=Create an element for the token=] for which the element |node| was created, in the
          [=HTML namespace=], with |common ancestor| as the intended parent; replace the entry for
          |node| in the [=list of active formatting elements=] with an entry for the new element,
          replace the entry for |node| in the [=stack of open elements=] with an entry for the new
          element, and let |node| be the new element.
      8. If |last node| is |furthest block|, then move the aforementioned bookmark to be immediately
          after the new |node| in the [=list of active formatting elements=].
      9. Insert |last node| into |node|, first removing it from its previous parent node if any.
      10. Let |last node| be |node|.
      11. Return to the step labeled |Inner loop|.
  15. Insert whatever |last node| ended up being in the previous step at the
      [=appropriate place for inserting a node=], but using |common ancestor| as the
      |override target|.
  16. [=Create an element for the token=] for which |formatting element| was created, in the
      [=HTML namespace=], with |furthest block| as the intended parent.
  17. Take all of the child nodes of |furthest block| and append them to the element created in the
      last step.
  18. Append that new element to |furthest block|.
  19. Remove |formatting element| from the [=list of active formatting elements=], and insert the
      new element into the [=list of active formatting elements=] at the position of the
      aforementioned bookmark.
  20. Remove |formatting element| from the [=stack of open elements=], and insert the new element
      into the [=stack of open elements=] immediately below the position of |furthest block| in that
      stack.
  21. Jump back to the step labeled |Outer loop|.

        Decrement the parser's [=script nesting level=] by one. If the parser's

        Let the [=insertion point=] have the value of the |old insertion point|. (In other words,
        restore the [=insertion point=] to its previous value. This value might be the "undefined"

### The end ### {#the-end}

  Once the user agent <dfn lt="stop parsing">stops parsing</dfn> the document, the user agent must
  run the following steps:

  1. Set the [=current document readiness=] to "`interactive`" and the [=insertion point=] to
      undefined.
  2. Pop *all* the nodes off the [=stack of open elements=].
  3. If the [=list of scripts that will execute when the document has finished parsing=] is not
      empty, run these substeps:

      1. [=Spin the event loop=] until the first <{script}> in the
          [=list of scripts that will execute when the document has finished parsing=] has its
          "[=ready to be parser-executed=]" flag set *and* the parser's {{Document}}
          [=has no style sheet that is blocking scripts=].
      2. [=Execute=] the first <{script}> in the
          [=list of scripts that will execute when the document has finished parsing=].
      3. Remove the first <{script}> element from the
          [=list of scripts that will execute when the document has finished parsing=] (i.e., shift
          out the first entry in the list).
      4. If the [=list of scripts that will execute when the document has finished parsing=] is
          still not empty, repeat these substeps again from substep 1.
  4. [=Queue a task=] to run the following substeps:

      1. [=fire an event=] named `DOMContentLoaded` at the {{Document}} object, with its
          {{Event/bubbles}} attribute initialized to true.
      2. Enable the [=client message queue=] of the {{ServiceWorkerContainer}} object whose
          associated [=service worker client=] is the {{Document}} object's
          [=relevant settings object=].
  5. [=Spin the event loop=] until the [=set of scripts that will execute as soon as possible=] and
      the [=list of scripts that will execute in order as soon as possible=] are empty.
  6. [=Spin the event loop=] until there is nothing that
      <dfn lt="delay the load event|delaying the load event">delays the load event</dfn>
      in the {{Document}}.
  7. [=Queue a task=] to run the following substeps:

      1. Set the [=current document readiness=] to "`complete`".
      2. *Load event*: If the {{Document}} has a [=browsing context=], then [=fire an event=] named
          `load` at the {{Document}} object's {{Window}} object, with |legacy target override flag|
          set.
  8. If the {{Document}} has a [=browsing context=], then [=queue a task=] to run the following
      substeps:

      1. If the {{Document}}'s [=page showing=] flag is true, then abort this task (i.e., don't fire
          the event below).
      2. Set the {{Document}}'s [=page showing=] flag to true.
      3. [=Fire an event=] named `pageshow` at the {{Document}} object's {{Window}} object using
          {{PageTransitionEvent}}, with the {{PageTransitionEvent/persisted}} attribute initialized
          to false, and |legacy target override flag| set.

      -->
  9. If the {{Document}}'s [=print when loaded=] flag is set, then run the [=printing steps=].
  10. The {{Document}} is now <dfn>ready for post-load tasks</dfn>.
  11. [=Queue a task=] to mark the {{Document}} as <dfn>completely loaded</dfn>.

  When the user agent is to <dfn lt="abort the parser|abort that parser">abort a parser</dfn>, it
  must run the following steps:

  1. Throw away any pending content in the [=input stream=], and discard any future content that
      would have been added to it.
  2. Set the [=current document readiness=] to "`interactive`".
  3. Pop *all* the nodes off the [=stack of open elements=].
  4. Set the [=current document readiness=] to "`complete`".

  Except where otherwise specified, the [=task source=] for the [=tasks=] mentioned in this section
  is the [=DOM manipulation task source=].

### Coercing an HTML DOM into an infoset ### {#coercing-an-html-dom-into-an-infoset}

  When an application uses an [=HTML parser=] in conjunction with an XML pipeline, it is possible
  that the constructed DOM is not compatible with the XML tool chain in certain subtle ways. For
  example, an XML toolchain might not be able to represent attributes with the name <{xmlns/xmlns}>,
  since they conflict with the Namespaces in XML syntax. There is also some data that the
  [=HTML parser=] generates that isn't included in the DOM itself. This section specifies some rules
  for handling these issues.

  If the XML API being used doesn't support DOCTYPEs, the tool may drop DOCTYPEs altogether.

  If the XML API doesn't support attributes in no namespace that are named "<{xmlns/xmlns}>",
  attributes whose names start with "`xmlns:`", or attributes in the [=XMLNS namespace=], then the
  tool may drop such attributes.

  The tool may annotate the output with any namespace declarations required for proper operation.

  If the XML API being used restricts the allowable characters in the local names of elements and
  attributes, then the tool may map all element and attribute local names that the API wouldn't
  support to a set of names that *are* allowed, by replacing any character that isn't supported with
  the uppercase letter U and the six digits of the character's Unicode code point when expressed in
  hexadecimal, using digits 0-9 and capital letters A-F as the symbols, in increasing numeric order.

  <p class="example">For example, the element name `foo&lt;bar`, which can be output by the
  [=HTML parser=], though it is neither a legal HTML element name nor a well-formed XML element
  name, would be converted into `fooU00003Cbar`, which *is* a well-formed XML element name (though
  it's still not legal in HTML by any means).</p>

  <p class="example">As another example, consider the attribute <{xlink/href|xlink:href}>. Used on a
  MathML element, it becomes, after being [=adjust foreign attributes|adjusted=], an attribute with
  a prefix "`xlink`" and a local name "`href`". However, used on an HTML element, it becomes an
  attribute with no prefix and the local name "<{xlink/href|xlink:href}>", which is not a valid
  NCName, and thus might not be accepted by an XML API. It could thus get converted, becoming
  "`xlinkU00003Ahref`".</p>

  <p class="note">The resulting names from this conversion conveniently can't clash with any
  attribute generated by the [=HTML parser=], since those are all either lowercase or those listed
  in the [=adjust foreign attributes=] algorithm's table.</p>

  If the XML API restricts comments from having two consecutive U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS characters (--),
  the tool may insert a single U+0020 SPACE character between any such offending characters.

  If the XML API restricts comments from ending in a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS character (-), the tool may
  insert a single U+0020 SPACE character at the end of such comments.

  If the XML API restricts allowed characters in character data, attribute values, or comments, the
  tool may replace any U+000C FORM FEED (FF) character with a U+0020 SPACE character, and any other
  literal non-XML character with a U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER.

  If the tool has no way to convey out-of-band information, then the tool may drop the following
  information:

  * Whether the document is set to *no-quirks mode*, *limited-quirks mode*, or *quirks mode*
  * The association between form controls and forms that aren't their nearest <{form}> element
      ancestor (use of the <a>`form` element pointer</a> in the parser)
  * The [=template contents=] of any <{template}> elements.

  <p class="note">The mutations allowed by this section apply *after* the [=HTML parser=]'s rules
  have been applied. For example, a `&lt;a::>` start tag will be closed by a `&lt;/a::>` end tag,
  and never by a `&lt;/aU00003AU00003A>` end tag, even if the user agent is using the rules above to
  then generate an actual element in the DOM with the name `aU00003AU00003A` for that start tag.</p>

### An introduction to error handling and strange cases in the parser ### {#an-introduction-to-error-handling-and-strange-cases-in-the-parser}

  *This section is non-normative.*

  This section examines some erroneous markup and discusses how the [=HTML parser=] handles these
  cases.

#### Misnested tags: &lt;b>&lt;i>&lt;/b>&lt;/i> #### {#misnested-tags-b-i-b-i}

  *This section is non-normative.*

  The most-often discussed example of erroneous markup is as follows:

  <xmp highlight="html" class="bad">
    <p>1<b>2<i>3</b>4</i>5</p>
  </xmp>

  The parsing of this markup is straightforward up to the "3". At this point, the DOM looks like
  this:

  <ul class="domTree">
    <li class="t1"><{html}>
    <ul>
      <li class="t1"><{head}>
      <li class="t1"><{body}>
      <ul>
        <li class="t1"><{p}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *1*
          <li class="t1"><{b}>
          <ul>
            <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *2*
            <li class="t1"><{i}>
            <ul>
              <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *3*
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  Here, the [=stack of open elements=] has five elements on it: <{html}>, <{body}>, <{p}>, <{b}>,
  and <{i}>. The [=list of active formatting elements=] just has two: <{b}> and <{i}>. The
  [=insertion mode=] is "[=in body=]".

  Upon receiving the end tag token with the tag name "b", the "[=adoption agency algorithm=]" is
  invoked. This is a simple case, in that the |formatting element| is the <{b}> element, and there
  is no |furthest block|. Thus, the [=stack of open elements=] ends up with just three elements:
  <{html}>, <{body}>, and <{p}>, while the [=list of active formatting elements=] has just one:
  <{i}>. The DOM tree is unmodified at this point.

  The next token is a character ("4"), triggers the
  [=reconstruct the active formatting elements|reconstruction of the active formatting elements=],
  in this case just the <{i}> element. A new <{i}> element is thus created for the "4" {{Text}}
  node. After the end tag token for the "i" is also received, and the "5" {{Text}} node is inserted,
  the DOM looks as follows:

  <ul class="domTree">
    <li class="t1"><{html}>
    <ul>
      <li class="t1"><{head}>
      <li class="t1"><{body}>
      <ul>
        <li class="t1"><{p}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *1*
          <li class="t1"><{b}>
          <ul>
            <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *2*
            <li class="t1"><{i}>
            <ul>
              <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *3*
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li class="t1"><{i}>
          <ul>
            <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *4*
          </ul>
          <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *5*
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

#### Misnested tags: &lt;b>&lt;p>&lt;/b>&lt;/p> #### {#misnested-tags-b-p-b-p}

  *This section is non-normative.*

  A case similar to the previous one is the following:

  <xmp highlight="html">
    <b>1<p>2</b>3</p>
  </xmp>

  Up to the "2" the parsing here is straightforward:

  <ul class="domTree">
    <li class="t1"><{html}>
    <ul>
      <li class="t1"><{head}>
      <li class="t1"><{body}>
      <ul>
        <li class="t1"><{b}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *1*
          <li class="t1"><{p}>
          <ul>
            <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *2*
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  The interesting part is when the end tag token with the tag name "b" is parsed.

  Before that token is seen, the [=stack of open elements=] has four elements on it: <{html}>,
  <{body}>, <{b}>, and <{p}>. The [=list of active formatting elements=] just has the one: <{b}>.
  The [=insertion mode=] is "[=in body=]".

  Upon receiving the end tag token with the tag name "b", the "[=adoption agency algorithm=]" is
  invoked, as in the previous example. However, in this case, there *is* a |furthest block|, namely
  the <{p}> element. Thus, this time the adoption agency algorithm isn't skipped over.

  The |common ancestor| is the <{body}> element. A conceptual "bookmark" marks the position of the
  <{b}> in the [=list of active formatting elements=], but since that list has only one element in
  it, the bookmark won't have much effect.

  As the algorithm progresses, |node| ends up set to the formatting element (<{b}>), and |last node|
  ends up set to the |furthest block| (<{p}>).

  The |last node| gets appended (moved) to the |common ancestor|, so that the DOM looks like:

  <ul class="domTree">
    <li class="t1"><{html}>
    <ul>
      <li class="t1"><{head}>
      <li class="t1"><{body}>
      <ul>
        <li class="t1"><{b}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *1*
        </ul>
        <li class="t1"><{p}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *2*
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  A new <{b}> element is created, and the children of the <{p}> element are moved to it:

  <ul class="domTree">
    <li class="t1"><{html}>
    <ul>
      <li class="t1"><{head}>
      <li class="t1"><{body}>
      <ul>
        <li class="t1"><{b}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *1*
        </ul>
        <li class="t1"><{p}>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <ul class="domTree">
    <li class="t1"><{b}>
    <ul>
      <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *2*
    </ul>
  </ul>

  Finally, the new <{b}> element is appended to the <{p}> element, so that the DOM looks like:

  <ul class="domTree">
    <li class="t1"><{html}>
    <ul>
      <li class="t1"><{head}>
      <li class="t1"><{body}>
      <ul>
        <li class="t1"><{b}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *1*
        </ul>
        <li class="t1"><{p}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t1"><{b}>
          <ul>
            <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *2*
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  The <{b}> element is removed from the [=list of active formatting elements=] and the
  [=stack of open elements=], so that when the "3" is parsed, it is appended to the <{p}> element:

  <ul class="domTree">
    <li class="t1"><{html}>
    <ul>
      <li class="t1"><{head}>
      <li class="t1"><{body}>
      <ul>
        <li class="t1"><{b}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *1*
        </ul>
        <li class="t1"><{p}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t1"><{b}>
          <ul>
            <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *2*
          </ul>
          <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *3*
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

#### Unexpected markup in tables #### {#unexpected-markup-in-tables}

  *This section is non-normative.*

  Error handling in tables is, for historical reasons, especially strange. For example, consider the
  following markup:

  <pre highlight="html">
    &lt;table><mark>&lt;b></mark>&lt;tr>&lt;td>aaa&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>bbb&lt;/table>ccc
  </pre>

  The highlighted <{b}> element start tag is not allowed directly inside a table like that, and the
  parser handles this case by placing the element *before* the table. (This is called
  [=foster parenting=].) This can be seen by examining the DOM tree as it stands just after the
  <{table}> element's start tag has been seen:

  <ul class="domTree">
    <li class="t1"><{html}>
    <ul>
      <li class="t1"><{head}>
      <li class="t1"><{body}>
      <ul>
        <li class="t1"><{table}>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  ...and then immediately after the <{b}> element start tag has been seen:

  <ul class="domTree">
    <li class="t1"><{html}>
    <ul>
      <li class="t1"><{head}>
      <li class="t1"><{body}>
      <ul>
        <li class="t1"><{b}>
        <li class="t1"><{table}>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  At this point, the [=stack of open elements=] has on it the elements <{html}>, <{body}>,
  <{table}>, and <{b}> (in that order, despite the resulting DOM tree); the
  [=list of active formatting elements=] just has the <{b}> element in it; and the
  [=insertion mode=] is "[=in table=]".

  The <{tr}> start tag causes the <{b}> element to be popped off the stack and a <{tbody}> start tag
  to be implied; the <{tbody}> and <{tr}> elements are then handled in a rather straight-forward
  manner, taking the parser through the "[=in table body=]" and "[=in row=]" insertion modes, after
  which the DOM looks as follows:

  <ul class="domTree">
    <li class="t1"><{html}>
    <ul>
      <li class="t1"><{head}>
      <li class="t1"><{body}>
      <ul>
        <li class="t1"><{b}>
        <li class="t1"><{table}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t1"><{tbody}>
          <ul>
            <li class="t1"><{tr}>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  Here, the [=stack of open elements=] has on it the elements <{html}>, <{body}>, <{table}>,
  <{tbody}>, and <{tr}>; the [=list of active formatting elements=] still has the <{b}> element in
  it; and the [=insertion mode=] is "[=in row=]".

  The <{td}> element start tag token, after putting a <{td}> element on the tree, puts a [=marker=]
  on the [=list of active formatting elements=] (it also switches to the "[=in cell=]"
  [=insertion mode=]).

  <ul class="domTree">
    <li class="t1"><{html}>
    <ul>
      <li class="t1"><{head}>
      <li class="t1"><{body}>
      <ul>
        <li class="t1"><{b}>
        <li class="t1"><{table}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t1"><{tbody}>
          <ul>
            <li class="t1"><{tr}>
            <ul>
              <li class="t1"><{td}>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  The [=marker=] means that when the "aaa" character tokens are seen, no <{b}> element is created to
  hold the resulting {{Text}} node:

  <ul class="domTree">
    <li class="t1"><{html}>
    <ul>
      <li class="t1"><{head}>
      <li class="t1"><{body}>
      <ul>
        <li class="t1"><{b}>
        <li class="t1"><{table}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t1"><{tbody}>
          <ul>
            <li class="t1"><{tr}>
            <ul>
              <li class="t1"><{td}>
              <ul>
                <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *aaa*
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  The end tags are handled in a straight-forward manner; after handling them, the
  [=stack of open elements=] has on it the elements <{html}>, <{body}>, <{table}>, and <{tbody}>;
  the [=list of active formatting elements=] still has the <{b}> element in it (the [=marker=]
  having been removed by the "td" end tag token); and the [=insertion mode=] is "[=in table body=]".

  Thus it is that the "bbb" character tokens are found. These trigger the "[=in table text=]"
  insertion mode to be used (with the [=original insertion mode=] set to "[=in table body=]"). The
  character tokens are collected, and when the next token (the <{table}> element end tag) is seen,
  they are processed as a group. Since they are not all spaces, they are handled as per the
  "anything else" rules in the "[=in table=]" insertion mode, which defer to the "[=in body=]"
  insertion mode but with [=foster parenting=].

  When
  [=reconstruct the active formatting elements|the active formatting elements are reconstructed=], a
  <{b}> element is created and [=foster parenting|foster parented=], and then the "bbb" {{Text}}
  node is appended to it:

  <ul class="domTree">
    <li class="t1"><{html}>
    <ul>
      <li class="t1"><{head}>
      <li class="t1"><{body}>
      <ul>
        <li class="t1"><{b}>
        <li class="t1"><{b}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *bbb*
        </ul>
        <li class="t1"><{table}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t1"><{tbody}>
          <ul>
            <li class="t1"><{tr}>
            <ul>
              <li class="t1"><{td}>
              <ul>
                <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *aaa*
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  The [=stack of open elements=] has on it the elements <{html}>, <{body}>, <{table}>, <{tbody}>,
  and the new <{b}> (again, note that this doesn't match the resulting tree!); the
  [=list of active formatting elements=] has the new <{b}> element in it; and the [=insertion mode=]
  is still "[=in table body=]".

  Had the character tokens been only [=space characters=] instead of "bbb", then those
  [=space characters=] would just be appended to the <{tbody}> element.

  Finally, the <{table}> is closed by a "table" end tag. This pops all the nodes from the
  [=stack of open elements=] up to and including the <{table}> element, but it doesn't affect the
  [=list of active formatting elements=], so the "ccc" character tokens after the table result in
  yet another <{b}> element being created, this time after the table:

  <ul class="domTree">
    <li class="t1"><{html}>
    <ul>
      <li class="t1"><{head}>
      <li class="t1"><{body}>
      <ul>
        <li class="t1"><{b}>
        <li class="t1"><{b}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *bbb*
        </ul>
        <li class="t1"><{table}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t1"><{tbody}>
          <ul>
            <li class="t1"><{tr}>
            <ul>
              <li class="t1"><{td}>
              <ul>
                <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *aaa*
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li class="t1"><{b}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: *ccc*
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

#### Scripts that modify the page as it is being parsed #### {#scripts-that-modify-the-page-as-it-is-being-parsed}

  *This section is non-normative.*

  Consider the following markup, which for this example we will assume is the document with
  [=url/URL=] `https://example.com/inner`, being rendered as the content of an <{iframe}> in another
  document with the [=url/URL=] `https://example.com/outer`:

  <xmp highlight="html">
    <div id="a">
      <script>
        var div = document.getElementById("a");
        parent.document.body.appendChild(div);
      </script>
      <script>
        alert(document.URL);
      </script>
    </div>
    <script>
      alert(document.URL);
    </script>
  </xmp>

  Up to the first "script" end tag, before the script is parsed, the result is relatively
  straightforward:

  <ul class="domTree">
    <li class="t1"><{html}>
    <ul>
      <li class="t1"><{head}>
      <li class="t1"><{body}>
      <ul>
        <li class="t1"><{div}> <span class="t2"><{global/id}>="a"</span>
        <ul>
          <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}:
          <li class="t1"><{script}>
          <ul>
            <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: var div = document.getElementById("a"); ⏎ parent.document.body.appendChild(div);
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  After the script is parsed, though, the <{div}> element and its child <{script}> element are gone:

  <ul class="domTree">
    <li class="t1"><{html}>
    <ul>
      <li class="t1"><{head}>
      <li class="t1"><{body}>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  They are, at this point, in the {{Document}} of the aforementioned outer [=browsing context=].
  However, the [=stack of open elements=] *still contains the <{div}> element*.

  Thus, when the second <{script}> element is parsed, it is inserted *into the outer {{Document}}
  object*.

  Those parsed into different {{Document}}s than the one the parser was created for do not execute,
  so the first alert does not show.

  Once the <{div}> element's end tag is parsed, the <{div}> element is popped off the stack, and so
  the next <{script}> element is in the inner {{Document}}:

  <ul class="domTree">
    <li class="t1"><{html}>
    <ul>
      <li class="t1"><{head}>
      <li class="t1"><{body}>
      <ul>
        <li class="t1"><{script}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: alert(document.URL);
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  This script does execute, resulting in an alert that says "https://example.com/inner".

#### The execution of scripts that are moving across multiple documents #### {#the-execution-of-scripts-that-are-moving-across-multiple-documents}

  *This section is non-normative.*

  Elaborating on the example in the previous section, consider the case where the second <{script}>
  element is an external script (i.e., one with a <{script/src}> attribute). Since the element was
  not in the parser's {{Document}} when it was created, that external script is not even downloaded.

  In a case where a <{script}> element with a <{script/src}> attribute is parsed normally into its
  parser's {{Document}}, but while the external script is being downloaded, the element is moved to
  another document, the script continues to download, but does not execute.

  <p class="note">In general, moving <{script}> elements between {{Document}}s is considered a bad
  practice.</p>

#### Unclosed formatting elements #### {#unclosed-formatting-elements}

  *This section is non-normative.*

  The following markup shows how nested formatting elements (such as <{b}>) get collected and
  continue to be applied even as the elements they are contained in are closed, but that excessive
  duplicates are thrown away.

  <xmp highlight="html">
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <p><b class="x"><b class="x"><b><b class="x"><b class="x"><b>X
    <p>X
    <p><b><b class="x"><b>X
    <p></b></b></b></b></b></b>X
  </xmp>

  The resulting DOM tree is as follows:

  <ul class="domTree">
    <li class="t10">DOCTYPE: `html`
    <li class="t1"><{html}>
    <ul>
      <li class="t1"><{head}>

        <li class="t1"><{p}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t1"><{b}> <span class="t2"><{global/class}>="x"</span>
          <ul>
            <li class="t1"><{b}>
            <ul>

                  <ul>
                    <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: X⏎

        </ul>
        <li class="t1"><{p}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t1"><{b}> <span class="t2"><{global/class}>="x"</span>
          <ul>
            <li class="t1"><{b}>
            <ul>
              <li class="t1"><{b}> <span class="t2"><{global/class}>="x"</span>
              <ul>
                <li class="t1"><{b}> <span class="t2"><{global/class}>="x"</span>
                <ul>
                  <li class="t1"><{b}>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="t1"><{b}>
                    <ul>
                      <li class="t1"><{b}> <span class="t2"><{global/class}>="x"</span>
                      <ul>
                        <li class="t1"><{b}>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: X⏎
                        </ul>
                      </ul>
                    </ul>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li class="t1"><{p}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t3">{{Text|#text}}: X⏎
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  Note how the second <{p}> element in the markup has no explicit <{b}> elements, but in the
  resulting DOM, up to three of each kind of formatting element (in this case three <{b}> elements
  with the class attribute, and two unadorned <{b}> elements) get reconstructed before the element's
  "X".

  Also note how this means that in the final paragraph only six <{b}> end tags are needed to
  completely clear the [=list of active formatting elements=], even though nine <{b}> start tags
  have been seen up to this point.

<h3 id="serializing-html-fragments">Serializing HTML fragments</h3>

  The following steps form the <dfn>HTML fragment serialization algorithm</dfn>. The algorithm takes
  as input a DOM {{Element}}, {{Document}}, or {{DocumentFragment}} referred to as |the node|, and
  returns a string.

  <p class="note">This algorithm serializes the *children* of the node being serialized, not the
  node itself.</p>

  1. Let |s| be a string, and initialize it to the empty string.
  2. If |the node| is a <{template}> element, then let |the node| instead be the <{template}>
      element's [=template contents=] (a {{DocumentFragment}} node).
  3. For each child node of |the node|, in [=tree order=], run the following steps:
      1. Let |current node| be the child node being processed.
      2. Append the appropriate string from the following list to |s|:

          <dl class="switch">
            : If |current node| is an {{Element}}
            :: If |current node| is an element in the [=HTML namespace=], the [=MathML namespace=],
                or the [=SVG namespace=], then let |tagname| be |current node|'s local name.
                Otherwise, let |tagname| be |current node|'s qualified name.

                Append a U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN character (&lt;), followed by |tagname|.

                <p class="note">For [=HTML elements=] created by the [=HTML parser=] or
                {{Document/createElement()}}, |tagname| will be lowercase.</p>

                For each attribute that the element has, append a U+0020 SPACE character, the
                [=attribute's serialized name|attribute's serialized name as described below=], a
                U+003D EQUALS SIGN character (=), a U+0022 QUOTATION MARK character (&quot;), the
                attribute's value, [=escaping a string|escaped as described below=] in
                *attribute mode*, and a second U+0022 QUOTATION MARK character (&quot;).

                An <dfn>attribute's serialized name</dfn> for the purposes of the previous paragraph
                must be determined as follows:

                <dl class="switch">
                  : If the attribute has no namespace
                  :: The attribute's serialized name is the attribute's local name.

                      <p class="note">For attributes on [=HTML elements=] set by the [=HTML parser=]
                      or by {{Element/setAttribute()|Element.setAttribute()}}, the local name will
                      be lowercase.</p>

                  : If the attribute is in the [=XML namespace=]
                  :: The attribute's serialized name is the string "`xml:`" followed by the
                      attribute's local name.

                  : If the attribute is in the [=XMLNS namespace=] and the attribute's local name
                      is <{xmlns/xmlns}>
                  :: The attribute's serialized name is the string "<{xmlns/xmlns}>".

                  : If the attribute is in the [=XMLNS namespace=] and the attribute's local name is
                      not <{xmlns/xmlns}>
                  :: The attribute's serialized name is the string "`xmlns:`" followed by the
                      attribute's local name.

                  : If the attribute is in the [=XLink namespace=]
                  :: The attribute's serialized name is the string "`xlink:`" followed by the
                      attribute's local name.

                  : If the attribute is in some other namespace
                  :: The attribute's serialized name is the attribute's qualified name.

                </dl>

                While the exact order of attributes is UA-defined, and may depend on factors such as
                the order that the attributes were given in the original markup, the sort order must
                be stable, such that consecutive invocations of this algorithm serialize an
                element's attributes in the same order.

                Append a U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN character (&gt;).

                If |current node| is an <{area}>, <{base}>, <{basefont}>, <{bgsound}>, <{br}>,
                <{col}>, <{embed}>, <{frame}>, <{hr}>, <{img}>, <{input}>, <{link}>, <{meta}>,
                <{param}>, <{source}>, <{track}> or <{wbr}> element, then continue on to the next
                child node at this point.

                Append the value of running the [=HTML fragment serialization algorithm=] on the
                |current node| element (thus recursing into this algorithm for that element),
                followed by a U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN character (&lt;), a U+002F SOLIDUS character
                (/), |tagname| again, and finally a U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN character (&gt;).

            : If |current node| is a {{Text}} node
            :: If the parent of |current node| is a <{style}>, <{script}>, <{xmp}>, <{iframe}>,
                <{noembed}>, <{noframes}>, or <{plaintext}> element, or if the parent of
                |current node| is a <{noscript}> element and [=scripting is enabled=] for the node,
                then append the value of |current node|'s {{CharacterData/data}} IDL attribute
                literally.

                Otherwise, append the value of |current node|'s {{CharacterData/data}} IDL
                attribute, [=escaping a string|escaped as described below=].

            : If |current node| is a {{Comment}}
            :: Append the literal string "`&lt;!--`" (U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN, U+0021 EXCLAMATION
                MARK, U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS), followed by the value of
                |current node|'s {{CharacterData/data}} IDL attribute, followed by the literal
                string "`--&gt;`" (U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, U+003E GREATER-THAN
                SIGN).

            : If |current node| is a {{ProcessingInstruction}}
            :: Append the literal string "`&lt;?`" (U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN, U+003F QUESTION MARK),
                followed by the value of |current node|'s {{ProcessingInstruction/target}} IDL
                attribute, followed by a single U+0020 SPACE character, followed by the value of
                |current node|'s {{CharacterData/data}} IDL attribute, followed by a single U+003E
                GREATER-THAN SIGN character (>).

            : If |current node| is a {{DocumentType}}
            :: Append the literal string "`&lt;!DOCTYPE`" (U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN, U+0021 EXCLAMATION
                MARK, U+0044 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D, U+004F LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O, U+0043 LATIN
                CAPITAL LETTER C, U+0054 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T, U+0059 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y,
                U+0050 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER P, U+0045 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E), followed by a space
                (U+0020 SPACE), followed by the value of |current node|'s {{DocumentType/name}} IDL
                attribute, followed by the literal string "`&gt;`" (U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN).
          </dl>
  4. The result of the algorithm is the string |s|.

  <p class="warning">It is possible that the output of this algorithm, if parsed with an
  [=HTML parser=], will not return the original tree structure. Tree structures that do not
  roundtrip a serialize and reparse step can also be produced by the [=HTML parser=] itself,
  although such cases are typically non-conforming.</p>

  <div class="example">
    For instance, if a <{textarea}> element to which a {{Comment}} node has been appended is
    serialized and the output is then reparsed, the comment will end up being displayed in the text
    field. Similarly, if, as a result of DOM manipulation, an element contains a comment that
    contains the literal string "`--&gt;`", then when the result of serializing the element is
    parsed, the comment will be truncated at that point and the rest of the comment will be
    interpreted as markup. More examples would be making a <{script}> element contain a {{Text}}
    node with the text string "`&lt;/script>`", or having a <{p}> element that contains a <{ul}>
    element (as the <{ul}> element's [=start tag=] would imply the end tag for the <{p}>).

    This can enable cross-site scripting attacks. An example of this would be a page that lets the
    user enter some font family names that are then inserted into a CSS <{style}> block via the DOM
    and which then uses the {{Element/innerHTML}} IDL attribute to get the HTML serialization of
    that <{style}> element: if the user enters "`&lt;/style>&lt;script>attack&lt;/script>`" as a
    font family name, {{Element/innerHTML}} will return markup that, if parsed in a different
    context, would contain a <{script}> node, even though no <{script}> node existed in the original
    DOM.
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    For example, consider the following markup:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <form id="outer"><div></form><form id="inner"><input>
    </xmp>

    This will be parsed into:

    <ul class="domTree">
      <li class="t1"><{html}>
      <ul>
        <li class="t1"><{head}>
        <li class="t1"><{body}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t1"><{form}> <span class="t2"><{global/id}>="outer"</span>
          <ul>
            <li class="t1"><{div}>
            <ul>
              <li class="t1"><{form}> <span class="t2"><{global/id}>="inner"</span>
              <ul>
                <li class="t1"><{input}>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    The input element will be associated with the inner form element. Now, if this tree structure is
    serialized and reparsed, the &lt;form id="inner"&gt; start tag will be ignored, and so the input
    element will be associated with the outer form element instead.

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
          &lt;form id=&quot;outer&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
              <mark>&lt;form id=&quot;inner&quot;&gt;</mark>
                &lt;input&gt;
              &lt;/form&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/form&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>

    <ul class="domTree">
      <li class="t1"><{html}>
      <ul>
        <li class="t1"><{head}>
        <li class="t1"><{body}>
        <ul>
          <li class="t1"><{form}> <span class="t2"><{global/id}>="outer"</span>
          <ul>

            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    As another example, consider the following markup:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <a><table><a>
    </xmp>

    This will be parsed into:

    <ul class="domTree">
      <li class="t1"><{html}>

            <li class="t1"><{a}>
            <li class="t1"><{table}>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    That is, the a elements are nested, because the second a element is foster parented. After a
    serialize-reparse roundtrip, the a elements and the table element would all be siblings, because
    the second &lt;a&gt; start tag implicitly closes the first a element.

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;a&gt;<mark>&lt;a&gt;</mark>&lt;/a&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

  For historical reasons, this algorithm does not round-trip an initial U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
  character in pre, textarea, or listing elements, even though (in the first two cases) the markup
  being round-tripped can be conforming. The HTML parser will drop such a character during parsing,
  but this algorithm does not serialize an extra U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character.

  <div class="example">
    For example, consider the following markup:

    <xmp highlight="html"><pre>

      Hello.</pre>
    </xmp>

    When this document is first parsed, the pre element's child text content starts with a single
    newline character. After a serialize-reparse roundtrip, the pre element's child text content is
    simply "Hello.".
  </div>

  <dfn>Escaping a string</dfn> (for the purposes of the algorithm above) consists of running the
  following steps:

  1. Replace any occurrence of the "`&amp;`" character by the string "`&amp;amp;`".
  2. Replace any occurrences of the U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE character by the string "`&amp;nbsp;`".
  3. If the algorithm was invoked in the *attribute mode*, replace any occurrences of the "`&quot;`"
      character by the string "`&amp;quot;`".
  4. If the algorithm was *not* invoked in the *attribute mode*, replace any occurrences of the
      "`&lt;`" character by the string "`&amp;lt;`", and any occurrences of the "`&gt;`" character
      by the string "`&amp;gt;`".

## Parsing HTML fragments ## {#parsing-html-fragments}

  The following steps form the <dfn>HTML fragment parsing algorithm</dfn>. The algorithm takes as
  input an {{Element}} node, referred to as the <dfn>context</dfn> element, which gives the context
  for the parser, as well as |input|, a string to parse, and returns a list of zero or more nodes.

  <p class="note">Parts marked <dfn>fragment case</dfn> in algorithms in the parser section are
  parts that only occur if the parser was created for the purposes of this algorithm. The algorithms
  have been annotated with such markings for informational purposes only; such markings have no
  normative weight. If it is possible for a condition described as a [=fragment case=] to occur even
  when the parser wasn't created for the purposes of handling this algorithm, then that is an error
  in the specification.</p>

  1. Create a new {{Document}} node, and mark it as being an [=HTML document=].
  2. If the [=node document=] of the |context| element is in [=quirks mode=], then let the
      {{Document}} be in [=quirks mode=]. Otherwise, the [=node document=] of the |context| element
      is in [=limited-quirks mode=], then let the {{Document}} be in [=limited-quirks mode=].
      Otherwise, leave the {{Document}} in [=no-quirks mode=].
  3. Create a new [=HTML parser=], and associate it with the just created {{Document}} node.
  4. Set the state of the [=HTML parser=]'s [[#tokenization|tokenization]] stage as follows,
      switching on the [=context=] element:

      <dl class="switch">
        : <{title}>
        : <{textarea}>
        :: Switch the tokenizer to the [=RCDATA state=].

        : <{style}>
        : <{xmp}>
        : <{iframe}>
        : <{noembed}>
        : <{noframes}>
        :: Switch the tokenizer to the [=RAWTEXT state=].

        : <{script}>
        :: Switch the tokenizer to the [=script data state=].

        : <{noscript}>
        :: If the [=scripting flag=] is enabled, switch the tokenizer to the [=RAWTEXT state=].
            Otherwise, leave the tokenizer in the [=data state=].

        : <{plaintext}>
        :: Switch the tokenizer to the [[#plaintext-state]].

        : Any other element
        :: Leave the tokenizer in the [=data state=].
      </dl>

      <p class="note">For performance reasons, an implementation that does not report errors and
      that uses the actual state machine described in this specification directly could use the
      PLAINTEXT state instead of the RAWTEXT and script data states where those are mentioned in the
      list above. Except for rules regarding parse errors, they are equivalent, since there is no
      [=appropriate end tag token=] in the fragment case, yet they involve far fewer state
      transitions.</p>
  5. Let |root| be a new <{html}> element with no attributes.
  6. Append the element |root| to the {{Document}} node created above.
  7. Set up the parser's [=stack of open elements=] so that it contains just the single element
      |root|.
  8. If the |context| element is a <{template}> element, push "[=in template=]" onto the
      [=stack of template insertion modes=] so that it is the new
      [=current template insertion mode=].
  9. Create a start tag token whose name is the local name of |context| and whose attributes are the
      attributes of |context|.

      Let this start tag token be the start tag token of the |context| node, e.g., for the purposes
      of determining if it is an [=HTML integration point=].
  10. [=reset the insertion mode appropriately|Reset the parser's insertion mode appropriately=].

      <p class="note">The parser will reference the |context| element as part of that algorithm.</p>
  11. Set the parser's <a>`form` element pointer</a> to the nearest node to the |context| element that
      is a <{form}> element (going straight up the ancestor chain, and including the element itself,
      if it is a <{form}> element), if any. (If there is no such <{form}> element, the
      <a>`form` element pointer</a> keeps its initial value, null.)
  12. Place the |input| into the [=input stream=] for the [=HTML parser=] just created. The encoding
      [=confidence=] is *irrelevant*.
  13. Start the parser and let it run until it has consumed all the characters just inserted into
      the input stream.
  14. Return the child nodes of |root|, in [=tree order=].

## Named character references ## {#named-character-references}

  This table lists the character reference names that are supported by HTML, and the code points to
  which they refer. It is referenced by the previous sections.

  <div id="named-character-references-table">
    <pre class="include">path: includes/entities.include</pre>
  </div>

  This data is also available <a href='entities.json'>as a JSON file</a>.

  *The glyphs displayed above are non-normative. Refer to the Unicode specifications for formal
  definitions of the characters listed above.*

  <p class="note">The character reference names originate from the
  <cite>XML Entity Definitions for Characters</cite> specification, though only the above is
  considered normative. [[[XML-ENTITY-NAMES]]]</p>
