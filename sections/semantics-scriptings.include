<h3 id="semantics-scripting">Scripting</h3>

  Scripts allow authors to add interactivity to their documents.

  Authors are encouraged to use declarative alternatives to scripting where possible, as
  declarative mechanisms are often more maintainable, and many users disable scripting.

  <div class="example">
    For example, instead of using script to show or hide a section to show more details, the
    <{details}> element could be used.

  </div>

  Authors are also encouraged to make their applications degrade gracefully in the absence of
  scripting support.

  <div class="example">
    For example, if an author provides a link in a table header to dynamically resort the table,
    the link could also be made to function without scripts by requesting the sorted table from the
    server.

  The <{script}> element allows authors to include dynamic script and data blocks in
  their documents. The element does not <a>represent</a> content for the
  user.

  When used to include dynamic scripts, the scripts may either be embedded inline or may be
  imported from an external file using the <code>src</code> attribute. If
  the language is not that described by "<code>text/javascript</code>", then the <code>type</code> attribute must be present, as described below. Whatever
  language is used, the contents of the <{script}> element must conform with the
  requirements of that language's specification.

  When used to include data blocks (as opposed to scripts), the data must be embedded inline, the
  format of the data must be given using the <code>type</code> attribute,
  the <code>src</code> attribute must not be specified, and the contents of
  the <{script}> element must conform to the requirements defined for the format used.

  The <dfn element-attr for="script"><code>type</code></dfn> attribute gives the language of the
  script or format of the data. If the attribute is present, its value must be a <a>valid MIME
  type</a>. The <code>charset</code> parameter must not be specified. The default, which
  is used if the attribute is absent, is "<code>text/javascript</code>".

  The <dfn element-attr for="script"><code>src</code></dfn> attribute, if specified, gives the
  address of the external script resource to use. The value of the attribute must be a <a>valid
  non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces</a> identifying a script resource of the type
  given by the <code>type</code> attribute, if the attribute is present, or
  of the type "<code>text/javascript</code>", if the attribute is absent. A resource is a
  script resource of a given type if that type identifies a scripting language and the resource
  conforms with the requirements of that language's specification.

  The <dfn element-attr for="script"><code>charset</code></dfn> attribute gives the character
  encoding of the external script resource. The attribute must not be specified if the <code>src</code> attribute is not present. If the attribute is set, its value
  must be an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for one of the <a lt="character encoding">labels</a> of an <a>encoding</a>, and must specify the same <a>encoding</a> as
  the <code>charset</code> parameter of the <a>Content-Type
  metadata</a> of the external file, if any. [[!ENCODING]]

  The <dfn element-attr for="script"><code>async</code></dfn> and <dfn element-attr for="script"><code>defer</code></dfn> attributes are <a>boolean attributes</a> that indicate how the script should be executed. The <code>defer</code> and <code>async</code> attributes
  must not be specified if the <code>src</code> attribute is not
  present.

  There are three possible modes that can be selected using these attributes. If the <code>async</code> attribute is present, then the script will be executed
  as soon as it is available, but without blocking further parsing of the page. If the <code>async</code>
  attribute is not present but the <code>defer</code> attribute is
  present, then the script is executed when the page has finished parsing. If neither attribute is
  present, then the script is fetched and executed immediately, before the user agent continues
  parsing the page. This is summarized in the following schematic diagram:

  <img src="images/asyncdefer.svg" style="width: 80%; min-width: 690px;" alt="With &lt;script>, parsing is interrupted by fetching and execution; with &lt;script defer>, fetching is parallel to parsing and execution takes place after all parsing has finished; and with &lt;script async>, fetching is parallel to parsing but once it finishes parsing is interrupted to execute the script." />

  <p class="note">
    The exact processing details for these attributes are, for mostly historical
  reasons, somewhat non-trivial, involving a number of aspects of HTML. The implementation
  requirements are therefore by necessity scattered throughout the specification. The algorithms
  below (in this section) describe the core of this processing, but these algorithms reference and
  are referenced by the parsing rules for <code>script</code> <a lt="start tag">start</a> and <a lt="end tag">end</a> tags in HTML, <a>in foreign content</a>,
  and in XML, the rules for the <a method lt="write()"><code>document.write()</code></a> method, the handling of <a>scripting</a>, etc.
  </p>

  The <a element-attr for="script"><code>defer</code></a> attribute may be specified even if the <code>async</code> attribute is specified, to cause legacy Web browsers that
  only support <code>defer</code> (and not <code>async</code>) to fall back to the <code>defer</code> behavior instead of the blocking behavior that
  is the default.

  The <dfn element-attr for="script"><code>crossorigin</code></dfn> attribute is a
  <a>CORS settings attribute</a>. It controls, for scripts that are obtained from other <a>origins</a>, whether error information will be exposed.

  Changing the <code>src</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>charset</code>, <code>async</code>, <code>defer</code>, and <code>crossorigin</code> attributes dynamically has no direct effect;
  these attribute are only used at specific times described below.

  <div class="impl">

  A <{script}> element has several associated pieces of state.

  The first is a flag indicating whether or not the script block has been <dfn>"already
  started"</dfn>. Initially, <{script}> elements must have this flag unset (script blocks,
  when created, are not "already started"). The <a>cloning
  steps</a> for <{script}> elements must set the "already started" flag on the copy if
  it is set on the element being cloned.

  The second is a flag indicating whether the element was <dfn>"parser-inserted"</dfn>.
  Initially, <{script}> elements must have this flag unset. It is set by the <a>HTML
  parser</a> and the <a>XML parser</a> on <{script}> elements they insert and
  affects the processing of those elements.

  The third is a flag indicating whether the element will <dfn>"non-blocking"</dfn>. Initially,
  <{script}> elements must have this flag set. It is unset by the <a>HTML parser</a>
  and the <a>XML parser</a> on <{script}> elements they insert. In addition, whenever
  a <{script}> element whose <a>"non-blocking"</a> flag is set has an <code>async</code> content attribute added, the element's
  <a>"non-blocking"</a> flag must be unset.

  The fourth is a flag indicating whether or not the script block is <dfn>"ready to be
  parser-executed"</dfn>. Initially, <{script}> elements must have this flag unset (script
  blocks, when created, are not "ready to be parser-executed"). This flag is used only for elements
  that are also <a>"parser-inserted"</a>, to let the parser know when to execute the
  script.

  The last few pieces of state are <dfn><var>the script block
  type</var></dfn>, <dfn><var>the script block character
  encoding</var></dfn>, and <dfn><var>the script block
  fallback character encoding</var></dfn>. They are determined when the script is prepared, based on
  the attributes on the element at that time, and the
  <{script}> element's <a>node document</a>.

  When a <{script}> element that is not marked as being <a>"parser-inserted"</a>
  experiences one of the events listed in the following list, the user agent must <a>immediately</a>
  prepare the <{script}> element:

  <ul>

    <li>The <{script}> element gets <a for="document">inserted into a document</a>, at the time the node is inserted
    according to the DOM, after any other <{script}> elements inserted at the same time that
    are earlier in the <code>Document</code> in <a>tree order</a>.</li>

    <li>The <{script}> element is <a>in a <code>Document</code></a> and a node or
    document fragment is <a>inserted</a> into the
    <{script}> element, after any <{script}> elements <a>inserted</a> at that time.</li>

    <li>The <{script}> element is <a>in a <code>Document</code></a> and has a <code>src</code> attribute set where previously the element had no such
    attribute.</li>

  </ul>

  To <dfn>prepare a script</dfn>, the user agent must act as
  follows:

  <ol>

    <li>

    If the <{script}> element is marked as having <a>"already started"</a>, then
    the user agent must abort these steps at this point. The script is not executed.

    </li>

    <li>

    If the element has its <a>"parser-inserted"</a> flag set, then set <var>was-parser-inserted</var> to true and unset the element's
    <a>"parser-inserted"</a> flag. Otherwise, set <var>was-parser-inserted</var> to
    false.

    <p class="note">
    This is done so that if parser-inserted <{script}> elements fail to run
    when the parser tries to run them, e.g., because they are empty or specify an unsupported
    scripting language, another script can later mutate them and cause them to run again.
  </p>

    </li>

    <li>

    If <var>was-parser-inserted</var> is true and the element does not have an <code>async</code> attribute, then set the element's
    <a>"non-blocking"</a> flag to true.

    <p class="note">
    This is done so that if a parser-inserted <{script}> element fails to
    run when the parser tries to run it, but it is later executed after a script dynamically updates
    it, it will execute in a non-blocking fashion even if the <code>async</code>
    attribute isn't set.
  </p>

    </li>

    <li id="script-processing-empty">

    If the element has no <code>src</code> attribute, and its child
    nodes, if any, consist only of comment nodes and empty <code>Text</code> nodes, then the user
    agent must abort these steps at this point. The script is not executed.

    </li>

    <li>

    If the element is not <a>in a <code>Document</code></a>, then the user agent must abort
    these steps at this point. The script is not executed.

      meantime). Either way, once the element is <a for="document">inserted into the document</a>, the load must have started as described in this
      step. If the user agent performs such prefetching, but the element is never inserted in the document,
      or the <code>src</code> attribute is dynamically changed, or the <code>crossorigin</code> attribute is dynamically changed, then the

  <ol>

    <li>

    If the element is flagged as <a>"parser-inserted"</a>, but the element's
    <a>node document</a> is not the <code>Document</code> of the parser that created the element,
    then abort these steps.

    </li>

    <li>

    Jump to the appropriate set of steps from the list below:

    <dl class="switch">

      <dt>If the load resulted in an error (for example a DNS error, or an HTTP 404 error)</dt>

      <dd>Executing the script block must just consist of <a>firing a simple event</a> named <code>error</code> at the element.</dd>

      <dt>If the load was successful</dt>

      <dd>

      Executing the script block must consist of running the following steps. For the purposes of
      these steps, the script is considered to be from an <i>external file</i> if, while the
      <a>prepare a script</a> algorithm above was running for this script, the
      <{script}> element had a <code>src</code> attribute
      specified.

        Initialize <dfn lt="is later used|the script block's source"><var>the script block's source</var></dfn>
        as follows:

          The contents of that file, interpreted as a Unicode string, are the script source.

          To obtain the Unicode string, the user agent run the following steps:

          <ol>

            <li>If the resource's <a>Content-Type metadata</a>, if any,
            specifies a character encoding, and the user agent supports that encoding, then let <var>character encoding</var> be that encoding, and jump to the bottom step in this
            series of steps.</li>

            <li>If the algorithm above set <var>the script

            <li>

            If the specification for <var>the script block's
            type</var> gives specific rules for decoding files in that format to Unicode, follow
            them, using <var>character encoding</var> as the character encoding specified by
            higher-level protocols, if necessary.

            Otherwise, <a>decode</a> the file to Unicode, using <var>character
            encoding</var> as the fallback encoding.

            <p class="note">

  set, then, on getting, the <code>async</code> IDL attribute must return
  true, and on setting, the <a>"non-blocking"</a> flag must first be unset, and then the
  content attribute must be removed if the IDL attribute's new value is false, and must be set to
  the empty string if the IDL attribute's new value is true. If the element's

  The IDL attribute <dfn attribute for="HTMLScriptElement"><code>text</code></dfn> must return a
  concatenation of the contents of all the <code>Text</code> nodes that are children of the

  order. On setting, it must act the same way as the {{Node/textContent}} IDL attribute.

  <p class="note">
    When inserted using the <a method lt="write()"><code>document.write()</code></a>

  <code>innerHTML</code> and <code>outerHTML</code>
  attributes, they do not execute at all.

  <div class="example">
    In this example, two <{script}> elements are used. One embeds an external script, and

    The data in this case might be used by the script to generate the map of a video game. The
    data doesn't have to be used that way, though; maybe the map data is actually embedded in other
    parts of the page's markup, and the data block here is just used by the site's search engine to
    help users who are looking for particular features in their game maps.

  <p class="note">
    The easiest and safest way to avoid the rather strange restrictions described in
  this section is to always escape "<code>&lt;!--</code>" as "<code>&lt;\!--</code>", "<code>&lt;script</code>" as "<code>&lt;\script</code>", and "<code>&lt;/script</code>" as "<code>&lt;\/script</code>" when these sequences appear in literals in scripts (e.g., in
  strings, regular expressions, or comments), and to avoid writing code that uses such constructs in
  expressions. Doing so avoids the pitfalls that the restrictions in this section are prone to
  triggering: namely, that, for historical reasons, parsing of <code>script</code> blocks in HTML is
  a strange and exotic practice that acts unintuitively in the face of these sequences.

  When a <{script}> element contains <a>script documentation</a>, there are
  further restrictions on the contents of the element, as described in the section below.

  <div class="example">
    The following script illustrates this issue. Suppose you have a script that contains a string,
    as in:

    <pre highlight="javascript">
      var example = 'Consider this string: &lt;!-- &lt;script&gt;';
      console.log(example);
    </pre>

    If one were to put this string directly in a <code>script</code> block, it would violate the
    restrictions above:

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;script&gt;
        var example = 'Consider this string: &lt;!-- &lt;script&gt;';
        console.log(example);
      &lt;/script&gt;
    </pre>

    The bigger problem, though, and the reason why it would violate those restrictions, is that
    actually the script would get parsed weirdly: <em>the script block above is not terminated</em>.
    That is, what looks like a "<code>&lt;/script&gt;</code>" end tag in this snippet is
    actually still part of the <code>script</code> block. The script doesn't execute (since it's not
    terminated); if it somehow were to execute, as it might if the markup looked as follows, it would
    fail because the script is not valid JavaScript:

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;script&gt;
        var example = 'Consider this string: &lt;!-- &lt;script&gt;';
        console.log(example);
      &lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;!-- despite appearances, this is actually part of the script still! --&gt;
      &lt;script&gt;
        ... // this is the same script block still...
      &lt;/script&gt;
    </pre>

    What is going on here is that for legacy reasons, "<code>&lt;!--</code>" and "<code>&lt;script</code>" strings in <{script}> elements in HTML need to be balanced
    in order for the parser to consider closing the block.

    By escaping the problematic strings as mentioned at the top of this section, the problem is
    avoided entirely:

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;script&gt;
        var example = 'Consider this string: &lt;\!-- &lt;\script&gt;';
        console.log(example);
      &lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;!-- this is just a comment between script blocks --&gt;
      &lt;script&gt;
        ... // this is a new script block
      &lt;/script&gt;
    </pre>

    It is possible for these sequences to naturally occur in script expressions, as in the
    following examples:

    <pre highlight="javascript">
      if (x&lt;!--y) { ... }
      if ( player&lt;script ) { ... }
    </pre>

    In such cases the characters cannot be escaped, but the expressions can be rewritten so that
    the sequences don't occur, as in:

    <pre highlight="javascript">
      if (x &lt; !--y) { ... }
      if (!--y &gt; x) { ... }
      if (!(--y) &gt; x) { ... }
      if (player &lt; script) { ... }
      if (script &gt; player) { ... }
    </pre>

    Doing this also avoids a different pitfall as well: for related historical reasons, the string
    "&lt;!--" in JavaScript is actually treated as a line comment start, just like "//".

<h5 id="interaction-of-script-elements-and-xslt">Interaction of <{script}> elements and XSLT</h5>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  This specification does not define how XSLT interacts with the <{script}> element.
  However, in the absence of another specification actually defining this, here are some guidelines
  for implementors, based on existing implementations:

  <ul>

    <li>When an XSLT transformation program is triggered by an <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt;</code> processing instruction and the browser implements a
    direct-to-DOM transformation, <{script}> elements created by the XSLT processor need to
    be marked <a>"parser-inserted"</a> and run in document order (modulo scripts marked <code>defer</code> or <code>async</code>),
    <a>immediately</a>, as the transformation is occurring.</li>

    <li>The <code>XSLTProcessor.transformToDocument()</code> method
    adds elements to a <code>Document</code> that is not in a <a>browsing context</a>, and,
    accordingly, any <{script}> elements they create need to have their <a>"already
    started"</a> flag set in the <a>prepare a script</a> algorithm and never get executed
    (<a>scripting is disabled</a>). Such <code>script</code>
    elements still need to be marked <a>"parser-inserted"</a>, though, such that their <code>async</code> IDL attribute will return false in the absence of an <code>async</code> content attribute.</li>

    <li>The <code>XSLTProcessor.transformToFragment()</code> method
    needs to create a fragment that is equivalent to one built manually by creating the elements
    using <code>document.createElementNS()</code>. For instance,
    it needs to create <{script}> elements that aren't <a>"parser-inserted"</a> and
    that don't have their <a>"already started"</a> flag set, so that they will execute when the
    fragment is <a for="document">inserted into a document</a>.</li>

  </ul>

  The main distinction between the first two cases and the last case is that the first two
  operate on <code>Document</code>s and the last operates on a fragment.

  The <{noscript}> element <a>represents</a> nothing if <a>scripting is enabled</a>, and <a>represents</a> its children if
  <a>scripting is disabled</a>. It is used to present different
  markup to user agents that support scripting and those that don't support scripting, by affecting
  how the document is parsed.

  When used in <a>HTML documents</a>, the allowed content model is as follows:

    the <{noscript}> element as the <var>context</var>
    element and the text contents as the <var>input</var> must result in a list of nodes
    that consists only of <{link}>, <{style}>, and <{meta}> elements that
    would be conforming if they were children of the <{noscript}> element, and no <a for="parser" lt="parse error">parse errors</a>.</dd>

    <dt>Outside of <{head}> elements, if <a>scripting is
    disabled</a> for the <{noscript}> element</dt>

    <dd>The <{noscript}> element's content model is <a>transparent</a>, with the
    additional restriction that a <{noscript}> element must not have a <code>noscript</code>
    element as an ancestor (that is, <code>noscript</code> can't be nested).</dd>

    <dt>Outside of <{head}> elements, if <a>scripting is
    enabled</a> for the <{noscript}> element</dt>

    <dd>

    The <{noscript}> element must contain only text, except that the text must be such
    that running the following algorithm results in a <a lt="conforming document">conforming document</a> with no
    <{noscript}> elements and no <{script}> elements, and such that no step in the
    algorithm throws an exception or causes an <a>HTML parser</a> to flag a <a for="parser">parse error</a>:

    <ol>

      <li>Remove every <{script}> element from the document.</li>

      <li>Make a list of every <{noscript}> element in the document. For every
      <{noscript}> element in that list, perform the following steps:

      <ol>

        <li>Let <var>s</var> be the concatenation of all the <code>Text</code> node
        children of the <{noscript}> element.</li>

        <li>Set the <code>outerHTML</code> attribute of the
        <{noscript}> element to the value of <var>s</var>. (This, as a
        side-effect, causes the <{noscript}> element to be removed from the document.) [[!DOMPARSING]]</li>

      </ol>

      </li>

    </ol>

    </dd>

  </dl>

  <p class="note">
    All these contortions are required because, for historical reasons, the
  <{noscript}> element is handled differently by the <a>HTML parser</a> based on
  whether <a>scripting was enabled or not</a> when the parser was
  invoked.
  </p>

  The <{noscript}> element must not be used in <a>XML documents</a>.

  <p class="note">
    The <{noscript}> element is only effective in <a href="#syntax">the HTML syntax</a>, it has no effect in <a href="#xhtml">the XHTML syntax</a>. This is because the way it works
  is by essentially "turning off" the parser when scripts are enabled, so that the contents of the
  element are treated as pure text and not as real elements. XML does not define a mechanism by
  which to do this.
  </p>

  <div class="impl">

  The <{noscript}> element has no other requirements. In particular, children of the
  <{noscript}> element are not exempt from [[#forms-form-submission]], scripting, and so
  forth, even when <a>scripting is enabled</a> for the element.

  </div>

  <div class="example">
    In the following example, a <{noscript}> element is
    used to provide fallback for a script.

    <pre highlight="html">
&lt;form action="calcSquare.php"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;label for=x&gt;Number&lt;/label&gt;:
  &lt;input id="x" name="x" type="number"&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
  var x = document.getElementById('x');
  var output = document.createElement('p');
  output.textContent = 'Type a number; it will be squared right then!';
  x.form.appendChild(output);
  x.form.onsubmit = function () { return false; }
  x.oninput = function () {
    var v = x.valueAsNumber;
    output.textContent = v + ' squared is ' + v * v;
  };
  &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;noscript&gt;
  &lt;input type=submit value="Calculate Square"&gt;
  &lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
    </pre>

    When script is disabled, a button appears to do the calculation on the server side. When
    script is enabled, the value is computed on-the-fly instead.

    The <{noscript}> element is a blunt instrument. Sometimes, scripts might be enabled,
    but for some reason the page's script might fail. For this reason, it's generally better to avoid
    using <{noscript}>, and to instead design the script to change the page from being a
    scriptless page to a scripted page on the fly, as in the next example:

    <pre highlight="html">
&lt;form action="calcSquare.php"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;label for=x&gt;Number&lt;/label&gt;:
  &lt;input id="x" name="x" type="number"&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;input id="submit" type=submit value="Calculate Square"&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
  var x = document.getElementById('x');
  var output = document.createElement('p');
  output.textContent = 'Type a number; it will be squared right then!';
  x.form.appendChild(output);
  x.form.onsubmit = function () { return false; }
  x.oninput = function () {
    var v = x.valueAsNumber;
    output.textContent = v + ' squared is ' + v * v;
  };
  var submit = document.getElementById('submit');
  submit.parentNode.removeChild(submit);
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
    </pre>

    The above technique is also useful in XHTML, since <code>noscript</code> is not supported in
    <a href="#xhtml">the XHTML syntax</a>.

  The <{template}> element is used to declare fragments of HTML that can be cloned and
  inserted in the document by script.

  <p class="note">
    Templates provide a method for declaring inert DOM subtrees and manipulating them to
  instantiate document fragments with identical contents.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    When web pages dynamically alter the contents of their documents (e.g., in response to user
  interaction or new data arriving from the server), it is common that they require fragments of
  HTML which may require further modification before use, such as the insertion of values
  appropriate for the usage context.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    The <{template}> element allows for the declaration of document fragments which are
  unused by the document when loaded, but are parsed as HTML and are available at runtime for use by
  the web page.
  </p>

  In a rendering, the <{template}> element <a>represents</a> nothing.

    <code>DocumentFragment</code> associated with a different {{Document}} so as to avoid
    the <{template}> contents interfering with the main {{Document}}. (For
    example, this avoids form controls from being submitted, scripts from executing, and so
    forth.)

  </dl>

  <div class="impl">

  Each <{template}> element has an associated <code>DocumentFragment</code> object that

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>doc</var> be the <{template}> element's <a>node document</a>'s <a>appropriate template contents owner

    In this example, a script populates a table four-column with data from a data structure, using

    This example uses <code>cloneNode()</code> on the <code>template</code>'s contents; it could
    equivalently have used <code>document.importNode()</code>, which does the same thing. The only
    difference between these two APIs is when the <a>node document</a> is updated: with
    <code>cloneNode()</code> it is updated when the nodes are appended with
    <code>appendChild()</code>, with <code>document.importNode()</code> it is updated when the nodes
    are cloned.

  element is available. For example, it is inappropriate to use a <{canvas}> element to
  render a page heading: if the desired presentation of the heading is graphically intense, it
  should be marked up using appropriate elements (typically <code>h1</code>) and then styled using
  CSS and supporting technologies such as Web Components.

  When authors use the <{canvas}> element, they must also provide content that, when
  presented to the user, conveys essentially the same function or purpose as the
  <code>canvas</code>' bitmap. This content may be placed as content of the <code>canvas</code>
  element. The contents of the <{canvas}> element, if any, are the element's <a>fallback
  content</a>.

  <hr />

  In interactive visual media, if <a>scripting is enabled</a> for
  the <{canvas}> element, and if support for <{canvas}> elements has been enabled,
  the <{canvas}> element <a>represents</a> <a>embedded content</a> consisting
  of a dynamically created image, the element's bitmap.

  In non-interactive, static, visual media, if the <{canvas}> element has been
  previously associated with a rendering context (e.g., if the page was viewed in an interactive
  visual medium and is now being printed, or if some script that ran during the page layout process
  painted on the element), then the <{canvas}> element <a>represents</a>
  <a>embedded content</a> with the element's current bitmap and size. Otherwise, the element
  represents its <a>fallback content</a> instead.

  In non-visual media, and in visual media if <a>scripting is
  disabled</a> for the <{canvas}> element or if support for <{canvas}> elements
  has been disabled, the <{canvas}> element <a>represents</a> its <a>fallback
  content</a> instead.

  When a <{canvas}> element <a>represents</a> <a>embedded content</a>, the
  user can still focus descendants of the <{canvas}> element (in the <a>fallback
  content</a>). When an element is <a>focused</a>, it is the target of keyboard interaction
  events (even though the element itself is not visible). This allows authors to make an interactive
  canvas keyboard-accessible: authors should have a one-to-one mapping of interactive regions to <i>focusable areas</i> in the <a>fallback content</a>. (Focus has no
  effect on mouse interaction events.) [[!UIEVENTS]]

  An element whose nearest <{canvas}> element ancestor is <a>being rendered</a>
  and <a>represents</a> <a>embedded content</a> is an element that is <dfn>being used as
  relevant canvas fallback content</dfn>.

  <hr />

  The <{canvas}> element has two attributes to control the size of the element's bitmap:
  <dfn element-attr for="canvas"><code>width</code></dfn> and <dfn element-attr for="canvas"><code>height</code></dfn>. These attributes, when specified, must have
  values that are <a>valid non-negative integers</a>. <span class="impl">The <a>rules for parsing non-negative integers</a> must be used to obtain their
  numeric values. If an attribute is missing, or if parsing its value returns an error, then the
  default value must be used instead.</span> The <code>width</code>
  attribute defaults to 300, and the <code>height</code> attribute
  defaults to 150.

  The <a>intrinsic dimensions</a> of the <{canvas}> element when it
  <a>represents</a> <a>embedded content</a> are equal to the dimensions of the
  element's bitmap.

  The user agent must use a square pixel density consisting of one pixel of image data per
  coordinate space unit for the bitmaps of a <code>canvas</code> and its rendering contexts.

  <p class="note">
    A <{canvas}> element can be sized arbitrarily by a style sheet, its
  bitmap is then subject to the 'object-fit' CSS property. [[!CSS3-IMAGES]]

  <hr />

  The bitmaps of <{canvas}> elements, the bitmaps of <code>ImageBitmap</code> objects,
  as well as some of the bitmaps of rendering contexts, such as those described in the section on
  the <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code> object below, have an <dfn for="canvas">origin-clean</dfn> flag, which can be set to true or false.
  Initially, when the <{canvas}> element or <code>ImageBitmap</code> object is created,
  its bitmap's <a>origin-clean</a> flag must be set to
  true.

  A <code>canvas</code> bitmap can also have a hit region list, as described in the
  <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code> section below.

  A <{canvas}> element can have a rendering context bound to it. Initially, it does not
  have a bound rendering context. To keep track of whether it has a rendering context or not, and
  what kind of rendering context it is, a <code>canvas</code> also has a <dfn mode for="canvas" lt="context mode|canvas context mode">canvas context mode</dfn>, which is initially <dfn context for="canvas">none</dfn> but can be changed to either <dfn context for="canvas">direct-2d</dfn>, <dfn context for="canvas">direct-webgl</dfn>, <dfn context for="canvas">indirect</dfn>, or <dfn context for="canvas">proxied</dfn> by algorithms defined in this specification.

  When its <a mode for="canvas">canvas context mode</a> is <a context for="canvas">none</a>, a <{canvas}> element has no rendering context,
  and its bitmap must be fully transparent black with an <a>intrinsic width</a> equal to the numeric value
  of the element's <code>width</code> attribute and an <a>intrinsic height</a>
  equal to the numeric value of the element's <code>height</code>
  attribute, those values being interpreted in CSS pixels, and being updated as the attributes are
  set, changed, or removed.

  When a <{canvas}> element represents <a>embedded content</a>, it <a>provides
  a paint source</a> whose width is the element's <a>intrinsic width</a>, whose height is
  the element's <a>intrinsic height</a>, and whose appearance is the element's bitmap.

  Whenever the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> content attributes are set, removed, changed, or
  redundantly set to the value they already have, if the <a mode for="canvas">canvas context mode</a> is <a context for="canvas">direct-2d</a>, the user agent must set bitmap dimensions to the numeric values of
  the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> content attributes.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLCanvasElement"><code>width</code></dfn> and <dfn attribute for="HTMLCanvasElement"><code>height</code></dfn> IDL attributes must <a>reflect</a> the
  respective content attributes of the same name, with the same defaults.

  There are two ways for a <{canvas}> element to acquire a rendering context: the

  These three methods are mutually exclusive; calling any of the three makes the other two start

  The <code>toDataURL()</code> method must not include color space

  In user agents that support CSS, the color space used by a <{canvas}> element must
  match the color space used for processing any colors for that element in CSS.

  The gamma correction and color space information of images must be handled in such a way that
  an image rendered directly using an <{img}> element would use the same colors as one
  painted on a <{canvas}> element that is then itself rendered. Furthermore, the rendering
  of images that have no color correction information (such as those returned by the <code>toDataURL()</code> method) must be rendered with no color

  <p class="example">For example, the value "<code>image/png</code>" would mean to generate a PNG
  image, the value "<code>image/jpeg</code>" would mean to generate a JPEG image, and the value
  "<code>image/svg+xml</code>" would mean to generate an SVG image (which would require that the
  user agent track how the bitmap was generated, an unlikely, though potentially awesome,
  feature).</p>

  User agents must support PNG ("<code>image/png</code>"). User agents may support other types.
  If the user agent does not support the requested type, it must create the file using the PNG
  format. [[!PNG]]

  User agents must <a lt="Converting a string to ASCII lowercase">convert the provided type to ASCII lowercase</a> before establishing if they support that type.

  For image types that do not support an alpha channel, the serialized image must be the bitmap
  image composited onto a solid black background using the source-over operator.

  If the first argument in <var>arguments</var> gives a type corresponding to one of the
  types given in the first column of the following table, and the user agent supports that type,
  then the subsequent arguments, if any, must be treated as described in the second cell of that
  row.

      default value, as if the argument had been omitted.</span>

  For the purposes of these rules, an argument is considered to be a number if it is converted to
  an IDL double value by the rules for handling arguments of type <code>any</code> in the
  Web IDL specification. [[!WEBIDL]]

  Other arguments must be ignored and must not cause the user agent to throw an exception. A
  future version of this specification will probably define other parameters to be passed to these
  methods to allow authors to more carefully control compression settings, image metadata, etc.

<h5 id="security-with-canvas-elements">Security with <{canvas}> elements</h5>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  <strong>Information leakage</strong> can occur if scripts from one <a>origin</a> can
  access information (e.g., read pixels) from images from another origin (one that isn't the same).

  To mitigate this, bitmaps used with <{canvas}> elements and <code>ImageBitmap</code>
  objects are defined to have a flag indicating whether they are <a>origin-clean</a>. All bitmaps start with their <a>origin-clean</a> set to true. The flag is set to
  false when cross-origin images or fonts are used.

  The <code>toDataURL()</code>, <code>toBlob()</code>, and <code>getImageData()</code> methods check the flag and will
  throw a <code>SecurityError</code> exception rather than leak cross-origin data.

  The value of the <a>origin-clean</a> flag is
  propagated from a source <{canvas}> element's bitmap to a new <code>ImageBitmap</code>
  object by <code>createImageBitmap()</code>. Conversely, a
  destination <{canvas}> element's bitmap will have its <a>origin-clean</a> flags set to false by <code>drawImage</code> if the source image is an
  <code>ImageBitmap</code> object whose bitmap has its <a>origin-clean</a> flag set to false.

  The flag can be reset in certain situations; for example, when a
  <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code> is bound to a new <{canvas}>, the bitmap is cleared
  and its flag reset.
