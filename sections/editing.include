<h2 id="editing">User interaction</h2>

<h3 id="the-hidden-attribute">The <dfn element-attr for="global"><code>hidden</code></dfn> attribute</h3>

  All <a>HTML elements</a> may have the <{global/hidden}> content attribute set. The
  <{global/hidden}> attribute is a <a>boolean attribute</a>. When specified on an element, it
  indicates that the element is not yet, or is no longer, directly relevant to the page's current
  state, or that it is being used to declare content to be reused by other parts of the page as
  opposed to being directly accessed by the user. User agents should not render
  elements that have the <{global/hidden}> attribute specified. This requirement may be
  implemented indirectly through the style layer. For example, an HTML+CSS user agent could
  implement these requirements using the rules suggested in [[#rendering]].

  <p class="note">
    Because this attribute is typically implemented using CSS, it's also possible to override it
    using CSS. For instance, a rule that applies 'display: block' to all elements will cancel the
    effects of the <{global/hidden}> attribute. Authors therefore have to take care when writing
    their style sheets to make sure that the attribute is still styled as expected.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    In the following skeletal example, the attribute is used to hide the Web game's main screen
    until the user logs in:

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;h1>The Example Game&lt;/h1>
      &lt;section>
        &lt;h2>Login&lt;/h2>
        &lt;form>
        ...
        &lt;!-- calls login() once the user's credentials have been checked -->
        &lt;/form>
        &lt;script>
        function login() {
          // switch screens
          document.getElementById('login').hidden = true;
          document.getElementById('game').hidden = false;
        }
        &lt;/script>
      &lt;/section>
      &lt;section hidden>
        ...
      &lt;/section>
    </pre>
  </div>

  The <{global/hidden}> attribute must not be used to hide content just from one presentation &mdash;
  if something is marked <{global/hidden}>, it is hidden from all presentations, including, for instance, screen readers.

  Elements that are not themselves <{global/hidden}> must not
  <a>hyperlink</a> to elements that are <{global/hidden}>. The <code>for</code> attributes of
  <{label}> and <{output}> elements that are not
  themselves <{global/hidden}> must similarly not refer to elements that are
  <{global/hidden}>. In both cases, such references would cause user confusion.

  Elements and scripts may, however, refer to elements that are <{global/hidden}> in other contexts.

  <div class="example">
    For example, it would be incorrect to use the <{links/href}> attribute to link to a
    section marked with the <{global/hidden}> attribute. If the content is not applicable
    or relevant, then there is no reason to link to it.

    It would be fine, however, to use the ARIA <{aria/aria-describedby}> attribute to
    refer to descriptions that are themselves <{global/hidden}>. While hiding the descriptions
    implies that they are not useful alone, they could be written in
    such a way that they are useful in the specific context of being
    referenced from the images that they describe.

    Similarly, a <{canvas}> element with the <{global/hidden}> attribute could be used by a
    scripted graphics engine as an off-screen buffer, and a form
    control could refer to a hidden <{form}> element using its
    <code>form</code> attribute.
  </div>

  Accessibility APIs are encouraged to provide a way to expose
  structured content while marking it as hidden in the default view.
  Such content should not be perceivable to users in the normal document
  flow in any modality, whether using Assistive Technology (AT) or
  mainstream User Agents.

  When such features are available, User Agents may use them to
  expose the full semantics of <{global/hidden}>
  elements to AT when appropriate, if such content is referenced
  indirectly by an <a lt="id">ID reference</a> or
  <a>valid hash-name reference</a>. This allows ATs to access the
  structure of these <{global/hidden}> elements
  upon user request, while keeping the content hidden in all
  presentations of the normal document flow. Authors who wish to prevent
  user-initiated viewing of a <{global/hidden}>
  element should not reference the element with such a mechanism.

  Because some User Agents have flattened hidden content when
  exposing such content to AT, authors should not reference <{global/hidden}> content which would lose essential
  meaning when flattened.

  Elements in a section hidden by the <{global/hidden}> attribute are still
  active, e.g., scripts and form controls in such sections still execute and submit respectively.
  Only their presentation to the user changes.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLElement"><code>hidden</code></dfn> IDL attribute must <a>reflect</a>
  the content attribute of the same name.

<h3 id="inert-subtrees">Inert subtrees</h3>

  <p class="note">
  This section <strong>does not</strong> define or create any content attribute
  named "inert". This section merely defines an abstract <em>concept</em> of
  <a>inertness</a>.
  </p>

  A node (in particular elements and text nodes) can be marked as <dfn lt="inertness|inert">inert</dfn>. When a node
  is <a>inert</a>, then the user agent must act as if the node was absent for the purposes of
  targeting user interaction events, may ignore the node for the purposes of text search user
  interfaces (commonly known as "find in page"), and may prevent the user from selecting text in
  that node. User agents should allow the user to override the restrictions on search and text
  selection, however.

  <p class="example">
  For example, consider a page that consists of just a single <a>inert</a>
  paragraph positioned in the middle of a <{body}>. If a user moves their pointing device
  from the <code>body</code> over to the <a>inert</a> paragraph and clicks on the paragraph,
  no <code>mouseover</code> event would be fired, and the <code>mousemove</code> and <code>click</code> events would
  be fired on the <{body}> element rather than the paragraph.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
  When a node is inert, it generally cannot be focused. Inert nodes that are <a>commands</a> will also get disabled.
  </p>

  While a <a>browsing context container</a> is marked as <a>inert</a>, its
  <a>nested browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a>, and all nodes in that
  {{Document}}, must be marked as <a>inert</a>.

  An entire <code>Document</code> can be marked as <dfn lt="blocked by the modal dialog|blocked by a modal dialog">blocked by a modal dialog</dfn>
  <var>subject</var>. While a <code>Document</code> is so marked, every node that is in the <code>Document</code>, with the exception of the <var>subject</var> element and its
  descendants, must be marked <a>inert</a>. (The elements excepted by this paragraph can
  additionally be marked <a>inert</a> through other means; being part of a modal dialog does not
  "protect" a node from being marked <a>inert</a>.)

  Only one element at a time can mark a <code>Document</code> as being <a>blocked by a modal
  dialog</a>. When a new <{dialog}> is made to block a {{Document}}, the previous element, if any, stops blocking the
  {{Document}}.

  <p class="note">
    The <{dialog}> element's <code>showModal()</code> method makes use of this mechanism.
  </p>

<h3 id="activation">Activation</h3>

  Certain elements in HTML have an <a>activation behavior</a>, which means that the user
  can activate them. This triggers a sequence of events dependent on the activation mechanism, and
  normally culminating in a <code>click</code> event, as described below.

  The user agent should allow the user to manually trigger elements that have an <a>activation
  behavior</a>, for instance using keyboard or voice input, or through mouse clicks. When the
  user triggers an element with a defined <a>activation behavior</a> in a manner other than
  clicking it, the default action of the interaction event must be to <a>run synthetic click
  activation steps</a> on the element.

  <p class="note">For accessibility, the keyboard's `Enter` and `Space` keys are often used to
  trigger an element's [=activation behavior=]. [[wai-aria-practices-1.1]]</p>

  Each element has a <var>click in progress</var> flag, initially set to false.

  When a user agent is to <dfn lt="running synthetic click activation steps|run synthetic click activation steps">run synthetic click activation steps</dfn> on an element, the user
  agent must run the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>If the element's <var>click in progress</var> flag is set to true, then abort
    these steps.</li>

    <li>Set the <var>click in progress</var> flag on the element to true.</li>

    <li><a>Run pre-click activation steps</a> on the element.</li>

    <li><a>Fire a <code>click</code> event</a> at the element. If the
    <a>run synthetic click activation steps</a> algorithm was invoked because the <code>click()</code> method was invoked, then the <code>isTrusted</code> attribute must be initialized to false.</li>

    <li>

    If this <code>click</code> event is not canceled, <a>run post-click
    activation steps</a> on the element.

    If the event <em>is</em> canceled, the user agent must <a>run canceled activation
    steps</a> on the element instead.

    </li>

    <li>Set the <var>click in progress</var> flag on the element to false.</li>

  </ol>

  When a pointing device is clicked, the user agent must <a>run authentic click activation
  steps</a> instead of firing the <code>click</code>
  event. When a user agent is to
  <dfn>run authentic click activation steps</dfn> for a given event <var>event</var>, it must
  follow these steps:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>target</var> be the element designated by the user (the target of <var>event</var>).</li>

    <li>If <var>target</var> is a <{canvas}> element, run the canvas {{MouseEvent}} rerouting steps. If this changes <var>event</var>'s
    target, then let <var>target</var> be the new target.</li>

    <li>Set the <var>click in progress</var> flag on <var>target</var> to
    true.</li>

    <li>Let <var>e</var> be the <a>nearest activatable element</a> of <var>target</var> (defined below), if any.</li>

    <li>If there is an element <var>e</var>, <a>run pre-click activation steps</a>
    on it.</li>

    <li>

    <a>Dispatch</a> <var>event</var> (the
    required <code>click</code> event) at <var>target</var>.

    If there is an element <var>e</var> and the <code>click</code>
    event is not canceled, <a>run post-click activation steps</a> on element <var>e</var>.

    If there is an element <var>e</var> and the event <em>is</em> canceled, <a>run
    canceled activation steps</a> on element <var>e</var>.

    </li>

    <li>Set the <var>click in progress</var> flag on <var>target</var> to
    false.</li>

  </ol>

  <p class="note">
    The algorithms above don't run for arbitrary synthetic events dispatched by author script. The
    <code>click()</code> method can be used to make the <a>run synthetic click activation steps</a>
    algorithm happen programmatically.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    Click-focusing behavior (e.g., the focusing of a text field when user clicks in one) typically
    happens before the click, when the mouse button is first depressed, and is therefore not
    discussed here.
  </p>

  Given an element <var>target</var>, the <dfn>nearest activatable element</dfn> is the element
  returned by the following algorithm:

  <ol>

    <li>If <var>target</var> has a defined <a>activation behavior</a>, then return
    <var>target</var> and abort these steps.</li>

    <li>If <var>target</var> has a parent element, then set <var>target</var> to
    that parent element and return to the first step.</li>

    <li>Otherwise, there is no <a>nearest activatable element</a>.</li>

  </ol>

  When a user agent is to <dfn>run pre-click activation steps</dfn> on an element, it must run
  the <dfn>pre-click activation steps</dfn> defined for that element, if any.

  When a user agent is to <dfn>run canceled activation steps</dfn> on an element, it must run the
  <dfn>canceled activation steps</dfn> defined for that element, if any.

  When a user agent is to <dfn>run post-click activation steps</dfn> on an element, it must run
  the <dfn>activation behavior</dfn> defined for that element, if any. Activation behaviors can
  refer to the <code>click</code> event that was fired by the steps above
  leading up to this point.

  <dl class="domintro">
    <dt><var>element</var> . <code>click</code>()</dt>
    <dd>Acts as if the element was clicked.</dd>
  </dl>

  The <dfn method for="HTMLElement"><code>click()</code></dfn> method must run the following steps:

  1. If the element is a form control that is disabled, abort these steps.
  2. <a>Run synthetic click activation steps</a> on the element.

<h3 id="focus">Focus</h3>

<h4 id="focus-introduction">Introduction</h4>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  An HTML user interface typically consists of multiple interactive widgets, such as form
  controls, scrollable regions, links, dialog boxes, browser tabs, and so forth. These widgets form
  a hierarchy, with some (e.g., browser tabs, dialog boxes) containing others (e.g., links, form
  controls).

  When interacting with an interface using a keyboard, key input is channeled from the system,
  through the hierarchy of interactive widgets, to an active widget, which is said to be
  <a>focused</a>.

  <div class="example">
    Consider an HTML application running in a browser tab running in a graphical environment.
    Suppose this application had a page with some text fields and links, and was currently showing a
    modal dialog, which itself had a text field and a button.

    The hierarchy of focusable widgets, in this scenario, would include the browser window, which
    would have, amongst its children, the browser tab containing the HTML application. The tab itself
    would have as its children the various links and text fields, as well as the dialog. The dialog
    itself would have as its children the text field and the button.

    <img src="images/focus-tree.png" alt="" width="800" height="450" />

    If the widget with <a>focus</a> in this example was the text field in the dialog box, then key
    input would be channeled from the graphical system to &#x2460; the Web browser, then to &#x2461;
    the tab, then to &#x2462; the dialog, and finally to &#x2463; the text field.
  </div>

  Keyboard <em>events</em> are always targeted at this <a>focused</a> element.

<h4 id="data-model">Data model</h4>

  The term <dfn lt="focusable|focusable area">focusable area</dfn> is used to refer to regions of the interface that can become
  the target of keyboard input. Focusable areas can be elements, parts of elements, or other regions
  managed by the user agent.

  Each <a>focusable area</a> has a <dfn>DOM anchor</dfn>, which is a <code>Node</code> object
  that represents the position of the <a>focusable area</a> in the DOM. (When the <a>focusable
  area</a> is itself a <code>Node</code>, it is its own <a>DOM anchor</a>.) The <a>DOM anchor</a> is
  used in some APIs as a substitute for the <a>focusable area</a> when there is no other DOM object
  to represent the <a>focusable area</a>.

  The following table describes what objects can be <a>focusable
  areas</a>. The cells in the left column describe objects that can be <a>focusable areas</a>; the cells in the right column describe the <a>DOM
  anchors</a> for those elements. (The cells that span both columns are non-normative examples.)

  An element that is the <a>DOM anchor</a> of a <a>focusable area</a> is said to

  <dfn>focused</dfn>.

  The <dfn>focus chain</dfn> of a <a>focusable area</a> or <a>control group owner object</a>

<h4 id="the-tabindex-attribute">The <code>tabindex</code> attribute</h4>

  The <dfn element-attr for="global"><code>tabindex</code></dfn> content attribute allows authors to
  indicate that an element is supposed to be <a>focusable</a>,
  whether it is supposed to be reachable using <a>sequential focus navigation</a> and, optionally,
  to suggest where in the sequential focus navigation order the element appears.

  <div class="warning">
    <p>
      Using a positive value for <{global/tabindex}> to specify the element's position in the
      <a>sequential focus navigation</a> order interacts with the order of all focusable elements.
      It is error-prone, and therefore not recommended. Authors should generally
      leave elements to appear in their default order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elements that do not receive focus by default can be made <a>focusable</a> using
      <code>tabindex="0"</code>. This value does not specify a particular position in the
      <a>sequential focus navigation</a> order. Instead, the element's position in the navigation
      order will be determined by the order in which the element appears in the document.
      However, authors should only make elements focusable if they act as interactive controls or widgets.
      In addition, authors should ensure that these focusable elements have an appropriate ARIA <code>role</code>
      attribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      For non-interactive elements that need to receive focus but that are not meant to be part of the <a>sequential focus navigation</a> order (for instance, the target of a skip link, or a container element that needs to be programmatically focused via JavaScript), authors should use a negative value of <code>tabindex="-1"</code>.
    </p>
  </div>

  The name "tab index" comes from the common use of the "tab" key to navigate through the focusable
  elements. The term "tabbing" refers to moving between focusable elements using sequential focus navigation.

  When the attribute is omitted, the user agent applies defaults. (There is no way to make an
  element that is <a>being rendered</a> be not focusable at all without <a>disabling</a> it or making it <a>inert</a>.)

  The <{global/tabindex}> attribute, if specified, must have a value
  that is a <a>valid integer</a>. Any valid value indicates that an element should be focusable.
  Positive number values also affect the relative position of the element's <a>focusable areas</a>
  in the <a>sequential focus navigation order</a>, as defined below.
  Negative number values indicate that the control should be unreachable by <a>sequential focus navigation</a>.

  Each element can have a <dfn lt="can be focused|tabindex focus flag">tabindex focus flag</dfn> set, as defined
  below. This flag is a factor that contributes towards determining whether an element is a
  <a>focusable area</a>, as described in the previous section.

  If the <{global/tabindex}> attribute is specified on an element, it
  must be parsed using the <a>rules for parsing integers</a>. The attribute's value must be interpreted as follows:

  <dl>

    <dt>If the attribute is omitted or parsing the value returns an error</dt>

    <dd>

    The user agent should follow platform conventions to determine if the element's
    <a>tabindex focus flag</a> is set and, if so, whether the element and any <a>focusable areas</a>
    that have the element as their <a>DOM anchor</a> can
    be reached using <a>sequential focus navigation</a>, and if so, what their relative
    position in the <a>sequential focus navigation order</a> is to be.

    Modulo platform conventions, it is suggested that for the following elements, the
    <a>tabindex focus flag</a> be set:

    <ul>

      <li><{a}> elements that have an <{links/href}> attribute</li>

      <li><{link}> elements that have an <{link/href}> attribute</li>

      <li><{button}> elements</li>

      <li><{input}> elements whose <{input/type}> attribute are
      not in the <{input/Hidden}> state</li>

      <li><{select}> elements</li>

      <li><{textarea}> elements</li>

      <li>Elements with a <{global/draggable}> attribute set, if that would
      enable the user agent to allow the user to begin a drag operations for those elements without
      the use of a pointing device</li>

      <li><{audio}> and <{video}> elements with a <code>controls</code> attribute</li>

      <li><a>Editing hosts</a></li>

      <li><a>Browsing context containers</a></li>

    </ul>

    </dd>

    <dt>If the value is a negative integer</dt>

    <dd>

    The user agent must set the element's <a>tabindex focus flag</a>, but should omit the
    element from the <a>sequential focus navigation order</a>.

    <p class="note">
    One valid reason to ignore the requirement that sequential focus navigation not
    allow the author to lead to the element would be if the user's only mechanism for moving the
    focus is sequential focus navigation. For instance, a keyboard-only user would be unable to
    click on a text field with a negative <{global/tabindex}>, so that
    user's user agent would be well justified in allowing the user to tab to the control
    regardless.

  </dl>

  <p class="note">
  In current user agent implementations, an element that is only focusable because of its <{global/tabindex}>
  attribute will generally <em>not</em> fire a <code>click</code> event in response to a non-mouse activation
  (e.g., hitting the "enter" key while the element is <a>focused</a>).
  </p>

  An element with the <{global/tabindex}> attribute specified is
  <a>interactive content</a>.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLElement"><code>tabIndex</code></dfn> IDL attribute must
  <a>reflect</a> the value of the <{global/tabindex}> content
  attribute. Its default value is 0 for elements that are focusable and are included in the
  <a>sequential focus navigation order</a>, and -1 for all other elements.

  <p class="warning">
  Most current browsers instead give the {{HTMLElement/tabIndex}} IDL attribute a value of 0 for some list of elements that are by default a <a>focusable area</a>, and -1 for other elements, if there is no <{global/tabindex}> content attribute set. This behaviour is not well-defined and will hopefully be improved in the future.</p>

  The <a>unfocusing steps</a> do not always result in the focus changing, even

  <hr />

  When a <a>focusable area</a> is added to an empty <a>control group</a>, it must be designated

  When a <a>dialog group</a> is formed, if the <a>dialog group manager</a> has an empty

  group</a>.

  <dfn>Focus fixup rule one</dfn>: When the designated <a>focused area of a control group</a> is removed from that <a>control group</a> in
  some way (e.g., it stops being a <a>focusable area</a>, it is removed from the DOM, it
  becomes <a for="/">expressly inert</a>, etc), and the <a>control
  group</a> is still not empty: designate the first non-<a>inert</a> <a>focused area</a> in that <a>control group</a> to be the new

  designate the first <a>focused area</a> in that
  <a>control group</a> to be the new <a>focused area of the control group</a> regardless
  of <a>inertness</a>. If such a removal instead results in the <a>control
  group</a> being empty, then there is simply no longer a <a>focused area of the control
  group</a>.

  <p class="example">
  For example, this might happen because an element is removed from its
  {{Document}}, or has a <{global/hidden}> attribute added. It might
  also happen to an <{input}> element when the element gets disabled.
  </p>

  <dfn>Focus fixup rule two</dfn>: When a <a>dialog group</a> has no designated <a>focused

  <dfn>Focus fixup rule three</dfn>: When the designated <a>focused dialog of a dialog group</a> is removed from that <a>dialog group</a> in
  some way (e.g., it stops <a>being rendered</a>, it loses its <code>open</code> attribute, it becomes <a for="/">expressly inert</a>, etc), and there is still a <a>dialog group</a> (because the
  <code>dialog</code> in question was not the last <code>dialog</code> in that <a>dialog group</a>):
  if the <a>dialog group</a>'s <a>manager</a>'s <a>control
  group</a> is non-empty, let there be no designated <a>focused dialog of the dialog group</a>
  any more; otherwise (in the case that the <a>control group</a> is empty), designate the first

<h4 id="sec-sequential-focus-navigation">Sequential focus navigation</h4>

  Each <a>control group</a> has a <dfn lt="sequential focus navigation|sequential focus navigation order">sequential focus navigation order</dfn>, which orders some
  or all of the <a>focusable areas</a> in the <a>control group</a>
  relative to each other. The order in the <a>sequential focus navigation order</a> does not
  have to be related to the order in the <a>control group</a> itself. If a <a>focusable area</a> is
  omitted from the <a>sequential focus navigation order</a> of its <a>control group</a>, then
  it is unreachable via <a>sequential focus navigation</a>.

  There can also be a <dfn>sequential focus navigation starting point</dfn>. It is initially
  unset. The user agent may set it when the user indicates that it should be moved.

  <p class="example">
  For example, the user agent could set it to the position of the user's click if
  the user clicks on the document contents.
  </p>

  When the user requests that focus move from the <a>currently focused area of a top-level
  browsing context</a> to the next or previous <a>focusable area</a> (e.g., as the default action
  of pressing the <kbd>tab</kbd> key), or when the user requests that focus sequentially move to a
  <a>top-level browsing context</a> in the first place (e.g., from the browser's location bar),
  the user agent must use the following algorithm:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>starting point</var> be the <a>currently focused area of a top-level
    browsing context</a>, if the user requested to move focus sequentially from there, or else the
    <a>top-level browsing context</a> itself, if the user instead requested to move focus from
    outside the <a>top-level browsing context</a>.</li>

    <li>If there is a <a>sequential focus navigation starting point</a> defined and it is
    inside <var>starting point</var>, then let <var>starting point</var> be the <a>sequential
    focus navigation starting point</a> instead.</li>

    <li>

    Let <var>direction</var> be <i>forward</i> if the user requested the <em>next</em>
    control, and <i>backward</i> if the user requested the previous control.

    <p class="note">
  Typically, pressing <kbd>tab</kbd> requests the next control, and pressing
    <kbd><kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>tab</kbd></kbd> requests the previous control.
  </p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <i>Loop</i>: Let <var>selection mechanism</var> be <i>sequential</i> if the <var>starting
    point</var> is a <a>browsing context</a> or if <var>starting point</var> is in its
    <a>control group</a>'s <a>sequential focus navigation order</a>.

    Otherwise, <var>starting point</var> is not in its <a>control group</a>'s
    <a>sequential focus navigation order</a>; let <var>selection mechanism</var> be
    <i>DOM</i>.

    </li>

    <li>Let <var>candidate</var> be the result of running the <a>sequential navigation search
    algorithm</a> with <var>starting point</var>, <var>direction</var>, and <var>selection
    mechanism</var> as the arguments.</li>

    <li>If <var>candidate</var> is not null, then run the <a>focusing steps</a> for
    <var>candidate</var> and abort these steps.</li>

    <li>Otherwise, unset the <a>sequential focus navigation starting point</a>.</li>

    <li>

    If <var>starting point</var> is the <a>top-level browsing context</a>, or a
    <a>focusable area</a> in the <a>top-level browsing context</a>, the user agent
    should transfer focus to its own controls appropriately (if any), honouring
    <var>direction</var>, and then abort these steps.

    <p class="example">
  For example, if <var>direction</var> is <i>backward</i>, then the last
    focusable control before the browser's rendering area would be the control to focus.
  </p>

    If the user agent has no focusable controls &mdash; a kiosk-mode browser, for instance
    &mdash;
    then the user agent may instead restart these steps with the <var>starting point</var> being the
    <a>top-level browsing context</a> itself.

    </li>

    <li>Otherwise, <var>starting point</var> is a <a>focusable area</a> in a
    <a>nested browsing context</a>. Let <var>starting point</var> be that
    <a>nested browsing context</a>'s <a>browsing context container</a>, and return to the
    step labeled <i>loop</i>.

    </li>

  </ol>

    For the purposes of this API, when a <a>child browsing context</a> is focused, its
    <a>browsing context container</a> is <a>focused</a> in the

    </dd>

    <dt><var>document</var> . <code>hasFocus</code>()</dt>

    <dd>

    Returns true if key events are being routed through or to the document; otherwise, returns

    </dd>

    <dt><var>element</var> . <code>blur</code>()</dt>

    <dd>

    Moves the focus to the <a>viewport</a>. Use of this method is discouraged; if you want to focus the
    <a>viewport</a>, call the <code>focus()</code> method on the <code>Document</code>'s <a>document element</a>.

    Do not use this method to hide the focus ring if you find the focus ring unsightly. Instead,
    use a CSS rule to override the 'outline' property, and provide a different way to show what
    element is focused. Be aware that if an alternative focusing style isn't made available, the
    page will be significantly less usable for people who primarily navigate pages using a keyboard,
    or those with reduced vision who use focus outlines to help them navigate the page.

    <div class="example">
      For example, to hide the outline from links and instead use a yellow background to indicate
      focus, you could use:

      <pre highlight="css">:link:focus, :visited:focus { outline: none; background: yellow; color: black; }</pre>
    </div>

    Do not use this method to hide the focus ring. Do not use any
    other method that hides the focus ring from keyboard users, in
    particular do not use a CSS rule to override the 'outline'
    property. Removal of the focus ring leads to serious accessibility
    issues for users who navigate and interact with interactive
    content using the keyboard.

  The <dfn method for="Document"><code>hasFocus()</code></dfn> method on the

  The <dfn method for="Window"><code>focus()</code></dfn> method on the <code>Window</code>

  <a>top-level browsing context</a>, user agents are encouraged to trigger some sort of
  notification to indicate to the user that the page is attempting to gain focus.

  The <dfn method for="Window"><code>blur()</code></dfn> method on the <code>Window</code>
  object, when invoked, provides a hint to the user agent that the script believes the user probably
  is not currently interested in the contents of the <a>browsing context</a> of the
  <code>Window</code> object on which the method was invoked, but that the contents might become
  interesting again in the future.

  User agents are encouraged to ignore calls to this <code>blur()</code>

  <p class="note">
  Historically, the <code>focus()</code> and <code>blur()</code> methods actually affected the system-level focus of the

  The <dfn method for="HTMLElement"><code>blur()</code></dfn> method, when invoked, should run the
  <a>unfocusing steps</a> for the element on which the method was called. User agents may
  selectively or uniformly ignore calls to this method for usability reasons.

  <p class="example">
  For example, if the <code>blur()</code> method is unwisely
  being used to remove the focus ring for aesthetics reasons, the page would become unusable by
  keyboard users. Ignoring calls to this method would thus allow keyboard users to interact with the
  page.

  <h4 id="focus-processing-model">Clipboard actions and focus</h4>
  
  <p>There are three clipboard actions that affect selection: cut, copy, and paste. Focus may follow selection, and user-agents handle this by default, but when custom clipboard actions are implemented the author needs to provide the following behaviors:</p>
  
  <dl>
  <dt>Cut action:</dt>
  <dd>When a cut action is performed, the selected object should be removed and the collapsed section set in place of the cut object.</dd>
  <dt>Copy action:</dt>

<h3 id="assigning-keyboard-shortcuts">Assigning keyboard shortcuts</h3>

<h4 id="assigning-keyboard-shortcuts-introduction">Introduction</h4>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  Each element that can be activated or focused can be assigned a shortcut key combination to
  activate it, using the <{global/accesskey}> attribute.

  The exact shortcut is determined by the user agent, potentially using information about the user's
  preferences, what keyboard shortcuts already exist on the platform, and what other shortcuts have
  been specified on the page, as well as the value of the <{global/accesskey}> attribute.

  A valid value for the <{global/accesskey}> attribute consists of a single printable character,

<h4 id="the-accesskey-attribute">The <code>accesskey</code> attribute</h4>

  All <a>HTML elements</a> may have the <dfn element-attr for="global"><code>accesskey</code></dfn>
  content attribute set. The <{global/accesskey}> attribute's value is used
  by the user agent as a guide for creating a keyboard shortcut that activates or focuses the
  element.

  If specified, the value must be a single printable character:
  typically a string one Unicode code point in length.

  <div class="warning">
    Decomposed characters in
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-html-css-normalization">Normalization Form D</a>,
    such as <code>accesskey="&amp;#x006E;&amp;#x0303;"</code>
    to assign <samp>ñ</samp> as a shortcut, are not valid values,
    and in many browsers no shortcut will be assigned. Characters in
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-html-css-normalization">Normalization Form C</a>
    are valid values. Printable characters that may represent more than one Unicode code point, such as
    <code>accesskey="श्र"</code>, are valid values.

    Authors should not use <a>space characters</a> such as <samp>" "</samp>,
    nor characters that cannot be generated by a single keystroke with no modifier keys,
    as a value of <{global/accesskey}>.

    Authors should not use an <{global/accesskey}> attribute with the same value, nor with a value
    that differs only by case, especially for ASCII characters, to two or more elements in the same document,
    as in some browsers, this causes the attribute to be ignored.

<h4 id="assigning-keyboard-shortcuts-processing-model">Processing model</h4>

  An element's <dfn>assigned access key</dfn> is a key combination derived from the element's
  <{global/accesskey}> content attribute, or assigned by the user agent, optionally
  based on a user preference. Initially, an element must not have an
  <a>assigned access key</a>.

  Whenever an element's <{global/accesskey}> attribute is set, changed,
  or removed, the user agent must update the element's <a>assigned access key</a> by running
  the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>If the element has no <{global/accesskey}> attribute, then skip
    to the <i>fallback</i> step below.</li>

    <li>The user agent may assign a key combination based on stored user preferences as the
    element's <a>assigned access key</a> and then abort these steps.</li>

    <li>Let <var>value</var> be the value of the <{global/accesskey}> attribute.

    <li>The user agent may strip content from <var>value</var> to reduce the length of
    <var>value</var> to a single unicode code point.</li>

    <li>If <var>value</var> is not a string of exactly one printable character,
    then the user agent may abort these steps.</li>

    <li>The user agent may assign a combination of a mix of zero or more modifier keys and
    <var>value</var> as the element's <a>assigned access key</a> and abort these steps.</li>

    <li><i>Fallback</i>: Optionally, the user agent may assign a key combination of its choosing
    as the element's <a>assigned access key</a> and then abort these steps.</li>

    <li>If this step is reached, the element has no <a>assigned access key</a>.</li>

  </ol>

  Once a user agent has selected and assigned an access key for an element, the user agent should
  not change the element's <a>assigned access key</a> unless the <{global/accesskey}> content
  attribute is changed or the element is moved to another {{Document}}.

  When the user presses the key combination corresponding to the <a>assigned access key</a>
  for an element, if the element defines a command, the
  command's <a for="facet">Hidden State</a> facet is false (visible),
  the command's <a for="facet">Disabled State</a> facet is also false
  (enabled), the element is <a>in a <code>Document</code></a> that has an associated
  <a>browsing context</a>, and neither the element nor any of its ancestors has a
  <{global/hidden}> attribute specified, then the user agent must either <a>focus</a> the element,
  or trigger the <a for="facet">Action</a> of the command.

  <p class="note">
  User agents might expose elements that have
  an <{global/accesskey}> attribute in other ways as well, e.g., in a menu
  displayed in response to a specific key combination, or with a user gesture.

  and <code>false</code>. The empty string and the <code>true</code> keyword map
  to the <i>true</i> state. The <code>false</code> keyword maps to the <i>false</i> state.
  In addition, there is a third state, the <i>inherit</i> state, which is the <i>missing value default</i> (and the <i>invalid value default</i>).

  The <i>true</i> state indicates that the element is editable. The <i>inherit</i> state
  indicates that the element is editable if its parent is. The <i>false</i> state indicates that the
  element is not editable.

  <dl class="domintro">

  The <dfn attribute for="ElementContentEditable"><code>contentEditable</code></dfn> IDL attribute,
  on getting, must return the string "<code>true</code>" if the content attribute is set to

    </dd>

  </dl>

  The <code>designMode</code> IDL attribute on the
  <code>Document</code> object takes two values, "<code>on</code>" and "<code>off</code>". On
  setting, the new value must be compared in an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> manner to these two
  values; if it matches the "<code>on</code>" value, then <code>designMode</code> must be enabled,
  and if it matches the "<code>off</code>" value, then <code>designMode</code> must be disabled.
  Other values must be ignored.

  On getting, if <code>designMode</code> is enabled, the IDL
  attribute must return the value "<code>on</code>"; otherwise it is disabled, and the
  attribute must return the value "<code>off</code>".

  The last state set must persist until the document is destroyed or the state is changed.
  Initially, documents must have their <code>designMode</code>
  disabled.

  When the <code>designMode</code> changes from being disabled to
  being enabled, the user agent must <a>immediately</a> reset the document's <a>active range</a>'s
  start and end boundary points to be at the start of the <code>Document</code> and then run the

<h4 id="best-practices-for-in-page-editors">Best practices for in-page editors</h4>

  Authors are encouraged to set the 'white-space' property on <a>editing
  hosts</a> and on markup that was originally created through these editing mechanisms to the
  value ''pre-wrap''. Default HTML white space handling is not well suited to WYSIWYG editing, and line
  wrapping will not work correctly in some corner cases if 'white-space' is left at its default
  value.

  <div class="example">
    As an example of problems that occur if the default ''normal'' value is used instead, consider
    the case of the user typing "<kbd>yellow&#x2423;&#x2423;ball</kbd>", with two spaces (here
    represented by "&#x2423;") between the words. With the editing rules in place for the default
    value of 'white-space' (''normal''), the resulting markup will either consist of
    "<samp>yellow&amp;nbsp;&nbsp;ball</samp>" or "<samp>yellow&nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ball</samp>"; i.e.,
    there will be a non-breaking space between the two words in addition to the regular space. This
    is necessary because the ''normal'' value for 'white-space' requires adjacent regular spaces to be
    collapsed together.

    In the former case, "<samp>yellow&#x237D;</samp>" might wrap to the next line ("&#x237D;"
    being used here to represent a non-breaking space) even though "<samp>yellow</samp>" alone might
    fit at the end of the line; in the latter case, "<samp>&#x237D;ball</samp>", if wrapped to the
    start of the line, would have visible indentation from the non-breaking space.

    When 'white-space' is set to ''pre-wrap'', however, the editing rules will instead simply put
    two regular spaces between the words, and should the two words be split at the end of a line, the
    spaces would be neatly removed from the rendering.

<h4 id="spelling-and-grammar-checking">Spelling and grammar checking</h4>

  User agents can support the checking of spelling and grammar of editable text, either in form
  controls (such as the value of <{textarea}> elements), or in elements in an <a>editing
  host</a> (e.g., using <{global/contenteditable}>).

  For each element, user agents must establish a <dfn>default behavior</dfn>, either through
  defaults or through preferences expressed by the user. There are
  three possible default behaviors for each element:

  <dl>

    <dt><dfn>true-by-default</dfn>

    <dd>The element will be checked for spelling and grammar if its contents are editable and
    spellchecking is not explicitly disabled through the <{global/spellcheck}> attribute.

    <dt><dfn>false-by-default</dfn>

    <dd>The element will never be checked for spelling and grammar unless spellchecking is
    explicitly enabled through the <{global/spellcheck}> attribute.

    <dt><dfn>inherit-by-default</dfn>

    <dd>The element's default behavior is the same as its parent element's. Elements that have no
    parent element cannot have this as their default behavior.

  </dl>

  <hr />

  The <dfn element-attr for="global"><code>spellcheck</code></dfn> attribute is an <a>enumerated
  attribute</a> whose keywords are the empty string, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. The empty string and the <code>true</code> keyword map to the
  <i>true</i> state. The <code>false</code> keyword maps to the <i>false</i> state. In
  addition, there is a third state, the <i>default</i> state, which is the <i>missing value default</i> (and the <i>invalid value default</i>).

  <p class="note">
  The <i>true</i> state indicates that the element is to have its spelling and
  grammar checked. The <i>default</i> state indicates that the element is to act according to a
  default behavior, possibly based on the parent element's own <{global/spellcheck}> state, as defined below. The <i>false</i> state
  indicates that the element is not to be checked.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <dl class="domintro">

    <dt><var>element</var> . {{HTMLElement/spellcheck}} [ = <var>value</var> ]</dt>

    <dd>

    Returns true if the element is to have its spelling and grammar checked; otherwise, returns
    false.

    Can be set, to override the default and set the <{global/spellcheck}> content attribute.

    </dd>

    <dt><var>element</var> . <code>forceSpellCheck</code>()</dt>

    <dd>

    Forces the user agent to report spelling and grammar errors on the element (if checking is
    enabled), even if the user has never focused the element. (If the method is not invoked, user
    agents can hide errors in text that wasn't just entered by the user.)

    </dd>

  </dl>

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLElement"><code>spellcheck</code></dfn> IDL attribute, on getting, must
  return true if the element's <{global/spellcheck}> content attribute is
  in the <i>true</i> state, or if the element's <{global/spellcheck}>
  content attribute is in the <i>default</i> state and the element's <a>default behavior</a> is <a>true-by-default</a>, or if the element's <{global/spellcheck}> content attribute is in the <i>default</i> state and the
  element's <a>default behavior</a> is <a>inherit-by-default</a> and the element's parent
  element's {{HTMLElement/spellcheck}} IDL attribute would return true;
  otherwise, if none of those conditions applies, then the attribute must instead return false.

  <p class="note">
  The {{HTMLElement/spellcheck}} IDL attribute is not affected
  by user preferences that override the <{global/spellcheck}> content
  attribute, and therefore might not reflect the actual spellchecking state.
  </p>

  On setting, if the new value is true, then the element's <{global/spellcheck}> content attribute must be set to the literal string
  "<code>true</code>", otherwise it must be set to the literal string "<code>false</code>".

  <hr />

  User agents must only consider the following pieces of text as checkable for the purposes of
  this feature:

  <ul>

    <li>The <a for="forms">value</a> of <{input}> elements whose <{input/type}> attributes are in the <{input/Text}>, <{input/Search}>,
    <{input/URL}>, or <{input/E-mail}> states and that are <a>mutable</a> (i.e., that do not have the <code>readonly</code> attribute specified and that are not disabled).</li>

    <li>The <a for="forms">value</a> of <{textarea}> elements that do not
    have a <code>readonly</code> attribute and that are not disabled.</li>

    <li>Text in {{Text}} nodes that are children of <a>editing
    hosts</a> or <a>editable</a> elements.</li>

    <li>Text in attributes of <a>editable</a> elements.</li>

  </ul>

  For text that is part of a {{Text}} node, the element with which the text is
  associated is the element that is the immediate parent of the first character of the word,
  sentence, or other piece of text. For text in attributes, it is the attribute's element. For the
  values of <code>input</code> and <{textarea}> elements, it is the element itself.

  To determine if a word, sentence, or other piece of text in an applicable element (as defined
  above) is to have spelling- and grammar-checking enabled, the user agent must use the following
  algorithm:

  <ol>

    <li>If the user has disabled the checking for this text, then the checking is disabled.</li>

    <li>Otherwise, if the user has forced the checking for this text to always be enabled, then the
    checking is enabled.</li>

    <li>Otherwise, if the element with which the text is associated has a <{global/spellcheck}> content attribute, then: if that attribute is in the
    <i>true</i> state, then checking is enabled; otherwise, if that attribute is in the <i>false</i>
    state, then checking is disabled.</li>

    <li>Otherwise, if there is an ancestor element with a <{global/spellcheck}> content attribute that is not in the <i>default</i>
    state, then: if the nearest such ancestor's <{global/spellcheck}>
    content attribute is in the <i>true</i> state, then checking is enabled; otherwise, checking is
    disabled.</li>

    <li>Otherwise, if the element's <a>default behavior</a>
    is <a>true-by-default</a>, then checking is
    enabled.</li>

    <li>Otherwise, if the element's <a>default behavior</a>
    is <a>false-by-default</a>, then checking is
    disabled.</li>

    <li>Otherwise, if the element's parent element has <em>its</em> checking enabled, then checking
    is enabled.</li>

    <li>Otherwise, checking is disabled.</li>

  </ol>

  If the checking is enabled for a word/sentence/text, the user agent should indicate spelling
  and grammar errors in that text. User agents should take into account the other semantics given in
  the document when suggesting spelling and grammar corrections. User agents may use the language of
  the element to determine what spelling and grammar rules to use, or may use the user's preferred
  language settings. user agents should use <{input}> element attributes such as <code>pattern</code> to ensure that the resulting value is valid, where
  possible.

  If checking is disabled, the user agent should not indicate spelling or grammar errors for that
  text.

  Even when checking is enabled, user agents may opt to not report spelling or grammar errors in
  text that the user agent deems the user has no interest in having checked (e.g., text that was
  already present when the page was loaded, or that the user did not type, or text in controls that
  the user has not focused, or in parts of e-mail addresses that the user agent is not confident
  were misspelt). The <dfn method for="HTMLElement"><code>forceSpellCheck()</code></dfn> method,
  when invoked on an element, must override this behavior, forcing the user agent to consider all
  spelling and grammar errors in text in that element for which checking is enabled to be of
  interest to the user.

  <div class="example">
    The element with ID "a" in the following example would be the one used to determine if the
    word "Hello" is checked for spelling errors. In this example, it would not be.

    <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;div contenteditable="true">
  &lt;span spellcheck="false">Hell&lt;/span>&lt;em>o!&lt;/em>
  &lt;/div>
  </pre>

    The element with ID "b" in the following example would have checking enabled (the leading
    space character in the attribute's value on the <{input}> element causes the attribute
    to be ignored, so the ancestor's value is used instead, regardless of the default).

    <pre class="bad">&lt;p spellcheck="true">
  &lt;label>Name: &lt;input spellcheck=" false">&lt;/label>
  &lt;/p></pre>
  </div>

  <p class="note">
  This specification does not define the user interface for spelling and grammar
  checkers. A user agent could offer on-demand checking, could perform continuous checking while the
  checking is enabled, or could use other interfaces.
  </p>

<h3 id="drag-and-drop">Drag and drop</h3>

  This section defines an event-based drag-and-drop mechanism.

  This specification does not define exactly what a <em>drag-and-drop operation</em> actually
  is.

  On a visual medium with a pointing device, a drag operation could be the default action of a
  <code>mousedown</code> event that is followed by a series of <code>mousemove</code> events, and the drop could be triggered by the mouse
  being released.

  When using an input modality other than a pointing device, users would probably have to
  explicitly indicate their intention to perform a drag-and-drop operation, stating what they wish
  to drag and where they wish to drop it, respectively.

  However it is implemented, drag-and-drop operations must have a starting point (e.g., where the
  mouse was clicked, or the start of the selection or element that was selected for the drag), may
  have any number of intermediate steps (elements that the mouse moves over during a drag, or
  elements that the user picks as possible drop points as he cycles through possibilities), and must
  either have an end point (the element above which the mouse button was released, or the element
  that was finally selected), or be canceled. The end point must be the last element selected as a
  possible drop point before the drop occurs (so if the operation is not canceled, there must be at
  least one element in the middle step).

<h4 id="drag-and-drop-introduction">Introduction</h4>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  To make an element draggable is simple: give the element a <{global/draggable}> attribute, and set an event listener for <code>dragstart</code> that stores the data being dragged.

  The event handler typically needs to check that it's not a text selection that is being
  dragged, and then needs to store data into the {{DataTransfer}} object and set the
  allowed effects (copy, move, link, or some combination).

  For example:

  <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;p>What fruits do you like?&lt;/p>
  &lt;ol ondragstart="dragStartHandler(event)">
  &lt;li draggable="true">Apples&lt;/li>
  &lt;li draggable="true">Oranges&lt;/li>
  &lt;li draggable="true">Pears&lt;/li>
  &lt;/ol>
  &lt;script>
  var internalDNDType = 'text/x-example'; // set this to something specific to your site
  function dragStartHandler(event) {
    if (event.target instanceof HTMLLIElement) {
      // use the element's data-value="" attribute as the value to be moving:
      event.dataTransfer.setData(internalDNDType, event.target.dataset.value);
      event.dataTransfer.effectAllowed = 'move'; // only allow moves
    } else {
      event.preventDefault(); // don't allow selection to be dragged
    }
  }
&lt;/script>
  </pre>

  <hr />

  To accept a drop, the drop target has to listen to the <code>drop</code> event.

  <p class="note">
  A drop
  target can handle the <code>dragenter</code> event (to report whether or
  not the drop target is to accept the drop) and the <code>dragover</code>
  event (to specify what feedback is to be shown to the user).
  </p>

  The <code>drop</code> event allows the actual drop to be performed. This
  event needs to be canceled, so that the {{DataTransfer/dropEffect}} attribute's value can be used by the source
  (otherwise it's reset).

  For example:

  <pre highlight="html">
    &lt;p>Drop your favorite fruits below:&lt;/p>
    &lt;ol ondrop="dropHandler(event)">
    &lt;!-- don't forget to change the "text/x-example" type to something
    specific to your site -->
    &lt;/ol>
    &lt;script>
    var internalDNDType = 'text/x-example'; // set this to something specific to your site
    function dropHandler(event) {
      var li = document.createElement('li');
      var data = event.dataTransfer.getData(internalDNDType);
      if (data == 'fruit-apple') {
        li.textContent = 'Apples';
      } else if (data == 'fruit-orange') {
        li.textContent = 'Oranges';
      } else if (data == 'fruit-pear') {
        li.textContent = 'Pears';
      } else {
        li.textContent = 'Unknown Fruit';
      }
      event.target.appendChild(li);
    }
    &lt;/script>
  </pre>

  <hr />

  To remove the original element (the one that was dragged) from the display, the <code>dragend</code> event can be used.

  For our example here, that means updating the original markup to handle that event:

  <pre highlight="html">
    &lt;p>What fruits do you like?&lt;/p>
    &lt;ol ondragstart="dragStartHandler(event)" ondragend="dragEndHandler(event)">
      &lt;!-- ...as before... -->
    &lt;/ol>
    &lt;script>
    function dragStartHandler(event) {
      // ...as before...
    }
    function dragEndHandler(event) {

  The data that underlies a drag-and-drop operation, known as the <dfn>drag data store</dfn>,
  consists of the following information:

  <ul>

    <li>A <dfn>drag data store item list</dfn>, which is a list of items representing the dragged
    data, each consisting of the following information:

    <dl>

      <dt><dfn lt="a drag data item kind|The drag data item kind|drag data item kind">The drag data item kind</dfn></dt>

      A Unicode string giving the type or format of the data, generally given by a <a>MIME
      type</a>. Some values that are not <a>MIME types</a> are
      special-cased for legacy reasons. The API does not enforce the use of <a>MIME types</a>; other values can be used as well. In all cases, however, the values
      are all converted to <a>ASCII lowercase</a> by the API.

      There is a limit of one <i>Plain Unicode string</i> item per <a>item type string</a>.

      </dd>

      <dt>The actual data</dt>

      <dd>A Unicode or binary string, in some cases with a file name (itself a Unicode string),

    The following information, used to generate the UI feedback during the drag:

    <ul>

      <li>User-agent-defined default feedback information, known as the <dfn>drag data store default

  {{DataTransfer}} objects are used during the <a>drag-and-drop events</a>, and are only valid while those events are being fired.

  A {{DataTransfer}} object is associated with a <a>drag data store</a> while it
  is valid.

  The <dfn attribute for="DataTransfer"><code>dropEffect</code></dfn> attribute controls
  the drag-and-drop feedback that the user is given during a drag-and-drop operation. When the
  {{DataTransfer}} object is created, the {{DataTransfer/dropEffect}} attribute is set to a string value. On
  getting, it must return its current value. On setting, if the new value is one of "<dfn value for="dropEffect"><code>none</code></dfn>", "<dfn value for="dropEffect"><code>copy</code></dfn>", "<dfn value for="dropEffect"><code>link</code></dfn>", or "<dfn value for="dropEffect"><code>move</code></dfn>", then the attribute's current value must be
  set to the new value. Other values must be ignored.

  The <dfn attribute for="DataTransfer"><code>effectAllowed</code></dfn> attribute is
  used in the drag-and-drop processing model to initialize the {{DataTransfer/dropEffect}} attribute during the <code>dragenter</code> and <code>dragover</code> events. When the {{DataTransfer}} object is
  created, the {{DataTransfer/effectAllowed}} attribute is set
  to a string value. On getting, it must return its current value. On setting, if <a>drag data
  store</a>'s mode is the <a>read/write mode</a> and the new value is one of "<dfn value for="effectAllowed"><code>none</code></dfn>", "<dfn value for="effectAllowed"><code>copy</code></dfn>", "<dfn value for="effectAllowed"><code>copyLink</code></dfn>", "<dfn value for="effectAllowed"><code>copyMove</code></dfn>", "<dfn value for="effectAllowed"><code>link</code></dfn>", "<dfn value for="effectAllowed"><code>linkMove</code></dfn>", "<dfn value for="effectAllowed"><code>move</code></dfn>", "<dfn value for="effectAllowed"><code>all</code></dfn>", or "<dfn value for="effectAllowed"><code>uninitialized</code></dfn>", then the attribute's
  current value must be set to the new value. Otherwise it must be left unchanged.

  The <dfn attribute for="DataTransfer"><code>items</code></dfn> attribute must return a
  {{DataTransferItemList}} object associated with the {{DataTransfer}} object.

  The <dfn method for="DataTransfer"><code>setDragImage(<var>element</var>, <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>)</code></dfn> method must run the following steps:

    store</a>, abort these steps. Nothing happens.</li>

    <li>If the <a>drag data store</a>'s mode is
    not the <a>read/write mode</a>, abort these steps. Nothing

    distinguished from the other values because it is not lowercase.)</li>

    <li>The strings produced by these steps are those in the list <var>L</var>.</li>

  The <dfn method for="DataTransfer"><code>clearData()</code></dfn> method must run the
  following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>If the {{DataTransfer}} object is no longer associated with a <a>drag data

  object is associated.

  The <dfn attribute for="DataTransferItem"><code>kind</code></dfn> attribute must return the
  empty string if the {{DataTransferItem}} object is in the <i>disabled mode</i>; otherwise
  it must return the string given in the cell from the second column of the following table from the
  row whose cell in the first column contains <a>the drag data item kind</a> of the item

    <tr> <td> <i>File</i> <td> "<code>file</code>"

  </table>

  The <dfn attribute for="DataTransferItem"><code>type</code></dfn> attribute must return the
  empty string if the {{DataTransferItem}} object is in the <i>disabled mode</i>; otherwise
  it must return <a>the drag data item type string</a> of the item represented by the
  {{DataTransferItem}} object.

  The <dfn method for="DataTransferItem"><code>getAsString(<var>callback</var>)</code></dfn> method must run the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>If the <var>callback</var> is null, abort these steps.</li>

<h4 id="the-dragevent-interface">The <code>DragEvent</code> interface</h4>

  The drag-and-drop processing model involves several events. They all use the
  {{DragEvent}} interface.

  <pre class="idl" data-highlight="webidl">
    [Constructor(DOMString type, optional DragEventInit eventInitDict)]
    interface DragEvent : MouseEvent {
      readonly attribute DataTransfer? dataTransfer;
    };

    dictionary DragEventInit : MouseEventInit {
      DataTransfer? dataTransfer = null;
    };
  </pre>

  <dl class="domintro">

    <dt><var>event</var> . {{DragEvent/dataTransfer}}</dt>

    <dd>

    Returns the {{DataTransfer}} object for the event.

    </dd>

  </dl>

  <p class="note">
  Although, for consistency with other event interfaces, the {{DragEvent}}
  interface has a constructor, it is not particularly useful. In particular, there's no way to
  create a useful {{DataTransfer}} object from script, as {{DataTransfer}} objects
  have a processing and security model that is coordinated by the browser during drag-and-drops.
  </p>

  The <dfn attribute for="DragEvent"><code>dataTransfer</code></dfn> attribute of the
  {{DragEvent}} interface must return the value it was initialized to. It represents the
  context information for the event.

  When a user agent is required to <dfn>fire a DND event</dfn> named <var>e</var> at an element,
  using a particular <a>drag data store</a>, and optionally with a specific <var>related
  target</var>, the user agent must run the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>dataDragStoreWasChanged</var> be false.</li>

    <li>If no specific <var>related target</var> was provided, set <var>related target</var> to
    null.</li>

    <li>Let <var>window</var> be the <code>Window</code> object of the <code>Document</code>
    object of the specified target element.</li>

    <li>
    If <var>e</var> is <code>dragstart</code>, then set the <a>drag data store mode</a> to the
    <a>read/write mode</a> and set <var>dataDragStoreWasChanged</var> to true.

    If <var>e</var> is <code>drop</code>, set the <a>drag data store mode</a> to the <a>read-only mode</a>.
    </li>

    <li>Let <var>dataTransfer</var> be a newly created {{DataTransfer}} object
    associated with the given <a>drag data store</a>.</li>

    <li>Set the {{DataTransfer/effectAllowed}} attribute to the <a>drag data
    store</a>'s <a>drag data store allowed effects state</a>.</li>

    <li>

    Set the {{DataTransfer/dropEffect}} attribute to "<code>none</code>" if <var>e</var> is <code>dragstart</code>, <code>drag</code>, <code>dragexit</code>, or <code>dragleave</code>; to the value corresponding to the <a>current
    drag operation</a> if <var>e</var> is <code>drop</code> or
    <code>dragend</code>; and to a value based on the {{DataTransfer/effectAllowed}} attribute's value and the
    drag-and-drop source, as given by the following table, otherwise (i.e., if <var>e</var>
    is <code>dragenter</code> or <code>dragover</code>):

    </table>

    Where the table above provides <dfn lt="if appropriate|possibly appropriate alternatives">possibly appropriate alternatives</dfn>, user agents may instead use the listed alternative values if
    platform conventions dictate that the user has requested those alternate effects.

    <p class="example">
  For example, Windows platform conventions are such that dragging while
    holding the "alt" key indicates a preference for linking the data, rather than moving or copying
    it. Therefore, on a Windows system, if "<code>link</code>" is an option according to
    the table above while the "alt" key is depressed, the user agent could select that instead of
    "<code>copy</code>" or "<code>move</code>".
  </p>

    </li>

    <li>

    Create a <a>trusted</a> {{DragEvent}} object
    and initialize it to have the given name <var>e</var>, to bubble, to be cancelable unless

    attributes initialized according to the state of the input devices as they would be for user
    interaction events, the <code>relatedTarget</code>
    attribute initialized to <var>related target</var>, and the {{DragEvent/dataTransfer}} attribute initialized to
    <var>dataTransfer</var>, the {{DataTransfer}} object created above.

    If there is no relevant pointing device, the object must have its <code>screenX</code>, <code>screenY</code>, <code>clientX</code>, <code>clientY</code>, and <code>button</code> attributes set to 0.

<h4 id="drag-and-drop-processing-model">Drag-and-drop processing model</h4>

  When the user attempts to begin a drag operation, the user agent must run the following steps.
  User agents must act as if these steps were run even if the drag actually started in another
  document or application and the user agent was not aware that the drag was occurring until it
  intersected with a document under the user agent's purview.

  <ol>

    <li>

    Determine what is being dragged, as follows:

    If the drag operation was invoked on a selection, then it is the selection that is being
    dragged.

    Otherwise, if the drag operation was invoked on a {{Document}}, it is the first
    element, going up the ancestor chain, starting at the node that the user tried to drag, that has
    the IDL attribute {{HTMLElement/draggable}} set to true. If there is no such
    element, then nothing is being dragged; abort these steps, the drag-and-drop operation is never
    started.

    Otherwise, the drag operation was invoked outside the user agent's purview. What is being
    dragged is defined by the document or application where the drag was started.

    <p class="note">
  <{img}> elements and <{a}> elements with an <{links/href}> attribute have their <{global/draggable}> attribute set to true by default.
  </p>

    </li>

    <li><a>Create a drag data store</a>. All the DND events fired subsequently by the steps
    in this section must use this <a>drag data store</a>.</li>

    <li>

    Establish which DOM node is the <dfn>source node</dfn>, as follows:

    If it is a selection that is being dragged, then the <a>source node</a> is the
    {{Text}} node that the user started the drag on (typically the {{Text}} node
    that the user originally clicked). If the user did not specify a particular node, for example if
    the user just told the user agent to begin a drag of "the selection", then the <a>source
    node</a> is the first {{Text}} node containing a part of the selection.

    Otherwise, if it is an element that is being dragged, then the <a>source node</a> is
    the element that is being dragged.

    Otherwise, the <a>source node</a> is part of another document or application. When this
    specification requires that an event be dispatched at the <a>source node</a> in this case,
    the user agent must instead follow the platform-specific conventions relevant to that
    situation.

    <p class="note">
      Multiple events are fired on the <a>source node</a> during the course of the drag-and-drop
      operation.
  </p>

    </li>

    <li>

    Determine the <dfn>list of dragged nodes</dfn>, as follows:

    If it is a selection that is being dragged, then the <a>list of dragged nodes</a>
    contains, in <a>tree order</a>, every node that is partially or completely included in the
    selection (including all their ancestors).

    Otherwise, the <a>list of dragged nodes</a> contains only the <a>source node</a>,
    if any.

    </li>

    <li>

    If it is a selection that is being dragged, then add an item to the <a>drag data store
    item list</a>, with its properties set as follows:

    <dl>

      <dt><a>The drag data item type string</a>
      <dd>"<code>text/plain</code>"</dd>

      <dt><a>The drag data item kind</a>
      <dd><i>Plain Unicode string</i></dd>

      <dt>The actual data</dt>
      <dd>The text of the selection</dd>

    </dl>

    Otherwise, if any files are being dragged, then add one item per file to the <a>drag data
    store item list</a>, with their properties set as follows:

    <dl>

      <dt><a>The drag data item type string</a>
      <dd>The MIME type of the file, if known, or "<code>application/octet-stream</code>" otherwise.</dd>

      <dt><a>The drag data item kind</a>
      <dd><i>File</i></dd>

      <dt>The actual data</dt>
      <dd>The file's contents and name.</dd>

    </dl>

    <p class="note">
  Dragging files can currently only happen from outside a <a>browsing
    context</a>, for example from a file system manager application.
  </p>

    If the drag initiated outside of the application, the user agent must add items to the
    <a>drag data store item list</a> as appropriate for the data being dragged, honoring
    platform conventions where appropriate; however, if the platform conventions do not use <a>MIME types</a> to label dragged data, the user agent must make a
    best-effort attempt to map the types to MIME types, and, in any case, all the <a>drag data item type strings</a> must be in <a>ASCII lowercase</a>.

    User agents may also add one or more items representing the selection or dragged element(s)
    in other forms, e.g., as HTML.

    </li>

    <li>

    If the <a>list of dragged nodes</a> is not empty, then extract the microdata from those nodes into a JSON form, and add one item to the
    <a>drag data store item list</a>, with its properties set as follows:

    <dl>

      <dt><a>The drag data item type string</a>
      <dd><code>application/microdata+json</code></dd>

      <dt><a>The drag data item kind</a>
      <dd><i>Plain Unicode string</i></dd>

      <dt>The actual data</dt>
      <dd>The resulting JSON string.</dd>

    </dl>

    </li>

    <li>

    Run the following substeps:

    <ol>

      <li>Let <var>urls</var> be an empty list of <a>absolute URLs</a>.</li>

      <li>

      For each <var>node</var> in the <a>list of dragged nodes</a>:

      <dl>

        <dt>If the node is an <{a}> element with an <{links/href}> attribute</dt>

        <dd>Add to <var>urls</var> the result of <a>parsing</a> the element's <{links/href}> content
        attribute relative to the element's <a>node document</a></dd>

        <dt>If the node is an <{img}> element with a <{img/src}>
        attribute</dt>

        <dd>Add to <var>urls</var> the result of <a>parsing</a> the element's <code>src</code> content attribute
        relative to the element's <a>node document</a></dd>

      </dl>

      </li>

      <li>If <var>urls</var> is still empty, abort these substeps.</li>

      <li>Let <var>url string</var> be the result of concatenating the strings in <var>urls</var>,
      in the order they were added, separated by a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED character
      pair (CRLF).</li>

      <li>Add one item to the <a>drag data store item list</a>, with its properties set as
      follows:

      <dl>

        <dt><a>The drag data item type string</a>
        <dd><code>text/uri-list</code></dd>

        <dt><a>The drag data item kind</a>
        <dd><i>Plain Unicode string</i></dd>

        <dt>The actual data</dt>
        <dd><var>url string</var></dd>

      </dl>

      </li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    <li>

    Update the <a>drag data store default feedback</a> as appropriate for the user agent
    (if the user is dragging the selection, then the selection would likely be the basis for this
    feedback; if the user is dragging an element, then that element's rendering would be used; if
    the drag began outside the user agent, then the platform conventions for determining the drag
    feedback should be used).

    </li>

    <li>

    <a>Fire a DND event</a> named <code>dragstart</code> at the
    <a>source node</a>.

    If the event is canceled, then the drag-and-drop operation should not occur; abort these
    steps.

    <p class="note">
  Since events with no event listeners registered are, almost by definition, never
    canceled, drag-and-drop is always available to the user if the author does not specifically
    prevent it.
  </p>

    </li>

    <li>

    <a>Initiate the drag-and-drop operation</a> in a manner consistent with platform
    conventions, and as described below.

    The drag-and-drop feedback must be generated from the first of the
    following sources that is available:

    <ol>

      <li>The <a>drag data store bitmap</a>, if any. In this case, the <a>drag data store
      hot spot coordinate</a> should be used as hints for where to put the cursor relative to the
      resulting image. The values are expressed as distances in CSS pixels from the left side and
      from the top side of the image respectively. [[!CSS-2015]]</li>

      <li>The <a>drag data store default feedback</a>.</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

  </ol>

  From the moment that the user agent is to <dfn lt="initiated|initiate the drag-and-drop operation">initiate the drag-and-drop operation</dfn>,
  until the end of the drag-and-drop operation, device input events (e.g., mouse and keyboard events)
  must be suppressed.

  During the drag operation, the element directly indicated by the user as the drop target is
  called the <dfn>immediate user selection</dfn>. (Only elements can be selected by the user; other
  nodes must not be made available as drop targets.) However, the <a>immediate user
  selection</a> is not necessarily the <dfn lt="previous target element|current target element">current target element</dfn>, which is the element
  currently selected for the drop part of the drag-and-drop operation.

  The <a>immediate user selection</a> changes as the user selects different elements
  (either by pointing at them with a pointing device, or by selecting them in some other way). The
  <a>current target element</a> changes when the <a>immediate user selection</a>
  changes, based on the results of event listeners in the document, as described below.

  Both the <a>current target element</a> and the <a>immediate user selection</a> can
  be null, which means no target element is selected. They can also both be elements in other
  (DOM-based) documents, or other (non-Web) programs altogether. (For example, a user could drag
  text to a word-processor.) The <a>current target element</a> is initially null.

  In addition, there is also a <dfn>current drag operation</dfn>, which can take on the values
  "<dfn value for="drag"><code>none</code></dfn>", "<dfn value for="drag"><code>copy</code></dfn>", "<dfn value for="drag"><code>link</code></dfn>", and "<dfn value for="drag"><code>move</code></dfn>". Initially, it has the value
  "<code>none</code>". It is updated by the user agent
  as described in the steps below.

  User agents must, as soon as the drag operation is <a>initiated</a> and every 350ms (&#xB1;200ms) thereafter for as long as the drag
  operation is ongoing, <a>queue a task</a> to perform the following steps in sequence:

  <ol>

    <li>

    If the user agent is still performing the previous iteration of the sequence (if any) when
    the next iteration becomes due, abort these steps for this iteration (effectively "skipping
    missed frames" of the drag-and-drop operation).

    </li>

    <li>

    <a>Fire a DND event</a> named <code>drag</code> at the
    <a>source node</a>. If this event is canceled, the user agent must set the <a>current
    drag operation</a> to "<code>none</code>" (no
    drag operation).

    </li>

    <li>

    If the <code>drag</code> event was not canceled and the user has not
    ended the drag-and-drop operation, check the state of the drag-and-drop operation, as
    follows:

    <ol>

      <li>

      If the user is indicating a different <a>immediate user selection</a> than during the
      last iteration (or if this is the first iteration), and if this <a>immediate user
      selection</a> is not the same as the <a>current target element</a>, then <a>fire a
      DND event</a> named <code>dragexit</code> at the <a>current
      target element</a>, and then update the <a>current target element</a> as follows:

      <dl class="switch">

        <dt>If the new <a>immediate user selection</a> is null</dt>

        <dd>Set the <a>current target element</a> to null also.</dd>

        <dt>If the new <a>immediate user selection</a> is in a non-DOM document or
        application</dt>

        <dd>Set the <a>current target element</a> to the <a>immediate user
        selection</a>.</dd>

        <dt>Otherwise</dt>

        <dd>

        <a>Fire a DND event</a> named <code>dragenter</code>
        at the <a>immediate user selection</a>.

        If the event is canceled, then set the <a>current target element</a> to the
        <a>immediate user selection</a>.

        Otherwise, run the appropriate step from the following list:

        <dl class="switch">

          <dt>If the <a>immediate user selection</a> is a text field (e.g.,
          <{textarea}>, or an <{input}> element whose <{input/type}> attribute is in the <a>Text</a> state) or an <a>editing host</a> or
          <a>editable</a> element, and the <a>drag data store item list</a> has an item
          with <a>the drag data item type string</a> "<code>text/plain</code>" and <a>the
          drag data item kind</a> <i>Plain Unicode string</i></dt>

          <dd>Set the <a>current target element</a> to the <a>immediate user
          selection</a> anyway.</dd>

          <dt>If the <a>immediate user selection</a> is <a href="#the-body-element">the <code>body</code> element</a></dt>

          <dd>Leave the <a>current target element</a> unchanged.</dd>

          <dt>Otherwise</dt>

          <dd>

          <a>Fire a DND event</a> named <code>dragenter</code>
          at <a href="#the-body-element">the <code>body</code> element</a>, if there is one, or at the <code>Document</code> object,
          if not. Then, set the <a>current target element</a> to <a href="#the-body-element">the <code>body</code> element</a>, regardless of whether that event was canceled or not.

          </dd>

        </dl>

        </dd>

      </dl>

      </li>

      <li>

      If the previous step caused the <a>current target element</a> to change, and if the
      previous target element was not null or a part of a non-DOM document, then <a>fire a DND
      event</a> named <code>dragleave</code> at the previous target
      element, with the new <a>current target element</a> as the specific <var>related
      target</var>.

      If the <a>current target element</a> is a DOM element, then <a>fire a DND
      event</a> named <code>dragover</code> at this <a>current
      target element</a>.

      If the <code>dragover</code> event is not canceled, run the
      appropriate step from the following list:

      <dl class="switch">

        <dt>If the <a>current target element</a> is a text field (e.g., <{textarea}>,
        or an <{input}> element whose <{input/type}> attribute
        is in the <a>Text</a> state) or an <a>editing
        host</a> or <a>editable</a> element, and the <a>drag data store item list</a>
        has an item with <a>the drag data item type string</a> "<code>text/plain</code>" and
        <a>the drag data item kind</a> <i>Plain Unicode string</i></dt>

        <dd>Set the <a>current drag operation</a> to either "<code>copy</code>" or "<code>move</code>", as appropriate given the platform
        conventions.</dd>

        <dt>Otherwise</dt>

        <dd>Reset the <a>current drag operation</a> to "<code>none</code>".</dd>

      </dl>

      Otherwise (if the <code>dragover</code> event <em>is</em>
      canceled), set the <a>current drag operation</a> based on the values of the {{DataTransfer/effectAllowed}} and {{DataTransfer/dropEffect}} attributes of the
      {{DragEvent}} object's {{DragEvent/dataTransfer}}
      object as they stood after the event <a>dispatch</a>
      finished, as per the following table:

          <tr>
            <th>{{DataTransfer/effectAllowed}}</th>
            <th>{{DataTransfer/dropEffect}}</th>

        </tr>
        <tr>

      <li>

      Otherwise, if the <a>current target element</a> is not a DOM element, use
      platform-specific mechanisms to determine what drag operation is being performed (none, copy,
      link, or move), and set the <a>current drag operation</a> accordingly.

      </li>

      <li>

      Update the drag feedback (e.g., the mouse cursor) to match the <a>current drag
      operation</a>, as follows:

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Drag operation</th>
            <th>Feedback</th>

        <tr>
          <td>"<code>copy</code>"</td>
          <td>Data will be copied if dropped here.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

        </tr>
      </table>

      </li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    <li>

    Otherwise, if the user ended the drag-and-drop operation (e.g., by releasing the mouse button
    in a mouse-driven drag-and-drop interface), or if the <code>drag</code>
    event was canceled, then this will be the last iteration. Run the following steps, then stop the
    drag-and-drop operation:

    <ol>

      <li>

      If the <a>current drag operation</a> is "<code>none</code>" (no drag operation), or, if the user
      ended the drag-and-drop operation by canceling it (e.g., by hitting the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key),
      or if the <a>current target element</a> is null, then the drag operation failed. Run
      these substeps:

      <ol>

        <li>Let <var>dropped</var> be false.</li>

        <li>If the <a>current target element</a> is a DOM element, <a>fire a DND
        event</a> named <code>dragleave</code> at it; otherwise, if
        it is not null, use platform-specific conventions for drag cancelation.</li>

        <li>Set the <a>current drag operation</a> to "<code>none</code>".</li>

      </ol>

      Otherwise, the drag operation might be a success; run these substeps:

      <ol>

        <li>Let <var>dropped</var> be true.</li>

        <li>If the <a>current target element</a> is a DOM element, <a>fire a DND
        event</a> named <code>drop</code> at it; otherwise, use
        platform-specific conventions for indicating a drop.</li>

        <li>

        If the event is canceled, set the <a>current drag operation</a> to the value of the
        {{DataTransfer/dropEffect}} attribute of the
        {{DragEvent}} object's {{DragEvent/dataTransfer}}
        object as it stood after the event <a>dispatch</a>
        finished.

        Otherwise, the event is not canceled; perform the event's default action, which depends
        on the exact target as follows:

        <dl class="switch">

          <dt>If the <a>current target element</a> is a text field (e.g., <{textarea}>,
          or an <{input}> element whose <{input/type}> attribute

          host</a> or <a>editable</a> element, and the <a>drag data store item
          list</a> has an item with <a>the drag data item type string</a>
          "<code>text/plain</code>" and <a>the drag data item kind</a> <i>Plain Unicode

          <dd>Insert the actual data of the first item in the <a>drag data store item

          data item kind</a> that is <i>Plain Unicode string</i> into the text field or
          <a>editing host</a> or <a>editable</a> element in a manner consistent with
          platform-specific conventions (e.g., inserting it at the current mouse cursor position, or
          inserting it at the end of the field).</dd>

          <dt>Otherwise</dt>

          <dd>Reset the <a>current drag operation</a> to "<code>none</code>".</dd>

      <li>

      <a>Fire a DND event</a> named <code>dragend</code> at the
      <a>source node</a>.

      </li>

      <li>

      Run the appropriate steps from the following list as the default action of the <code>dragend</code> event:

      <dl class="switch">

        <dt>If <var>dropped</var> is true, the <a>current target element</a> is a <i>text
        field</i> (see below), the <a>current drag operation</a> is "<code>move</code>", and the source of the
        drag-and-drop operation is a selection in the DOM that is entirely contained within an
        <a>editing host</a></dt>

        <dd><a>Delete the selection</a>.</dd>

        <dt>If <var>dropped</var> is true, the <a>current target element</a> is a <i>text
        field</i> (see below), the <a>current drag operation</a> is "<code>move</code>", and the source of the
        drag-and-drop operation is a selection in a text field</dt>

        <dd>The user agent should delete the dragged selection from the relevant text
        field.</dd>

        <dt>If <var>dropped</var> is false or if the <a>current drag operation</a> is "<code>none</code>"</dt>

        <dd>The drag was canceled. If the platform conventions dictate that this be represented to
        the user (e.g., by animating the dragged selection going back to the source of the
        drag-and-drop operation), then do so.</dd>

        <dt>Otherwise</dt>

        <dd>The event has no default action.</dd>

      </dl>

      For the purposes of this step, a <i>text field</i> is a <{textarea}> element or an
      <{input}> element whose <{input/type}> attribute is in
      one of the
      <{input/Text}>,
      <{input/Search}>,
      <{input/Telephone}>,
      <{input/URL}>,

      states.

    <p class="note">
      User agents are encouraged to consider how to react to drags near the edge of scrollable
      regions. For example, if a user drags a link to the bottom of the <a>viewport</a> on a long page, it
      might make sense to scroll the page so that the user can drop the link lower on the page.

  Not shown in the above table: all these events bubble, and the {{DataTransfer/effectAllowed}}
  attribute always has the value it had after the <code>dragstart</code> event, defaulting to
  "<code>uninitialized</code>" in the <code>dragstart</code> event.

<h4 id="the-draggable-attribute">The <code>draggable</code> attribute</h4>

  All <a>HTML elements</a> may have the <dfn element-attr for="global"><code>draggable</code></dfn> content attribute set. The
  <{global/draggable}> attribute is an <a>enumerated attribute</a>. It has three states. The first
  state is <i>true</i> and it has the keyword <code>true</code>. The second state is <i>false</i>
  and it has the keyword <code>false</code>. The third state is <i>auto</i>; it has no keywords but
  it is the <i>missing value default</i>.

  The <i>true</i> state means the element is draggable; the <i>false</i> state means that it is not.
  The <i>auto</i> state uses the default behavior of the user agent.

  An element with a <{global/draggable}> attribute should also have a <{global/title}> attribute
  that names the element for the purpose of non-visual interactions.

  <dl class="domintro">
    <dt><var>element</var> . {{HTMLElement/draggable}} [ = <var>value</var> ]</dt>
    <dd>
    Returns true if the element is draggable; otherwise, returns false.

    Can be set, to override the default and set the <{global/draggable}>
    content attribute.
    </dd>
  </dl>

    The <dfn attribute for="HTMLElement"><code>draggable</code></dfn> IDL attribute, whose value depends on the content
    attribute's in the way described below, controls whether or not the element is draggable.
    Generally, only text selections are draggable, but elements whose {{HTMLElement/draggable}} IDL
    attribute is true become draggable as well.

    If an element's <{global/draggable}> content attribute has the state <i>true</i>, the
    {{HTMLElement/draggable}} IDL attribute must return true.

    Otherwise, if the element's <{global/draggable}> content attribute has the state <i>false</i>,
    the {{HTMLElement/draggable}} IDL attribute must return false.

    Otherwise, the element's <{global/draggable}> content attribute has the state <i>auto</i>. If
    the element is an <{img}> element, an <{object}> element that
    <a>represents</a> an image, or an <{a}> element with an <{links/href}> content
    attribute, the {{HTMLElement/draggable}} IDL attribute must return true; otherwise, the
    {{HTMLElement/draggable}} IDL attribute must return false.

    If the {{HTMLElement/draggable}} IDL attribute is set to the value false, the
    <{global/draggable}> content attribute must be set to the literal value "<code>false</code>".
    If the {{HTMLElement/draggable}} IDL attribute is set to the value true, the <{global/draggable}>
    content attribute must be set to the literal value "<code>true</code>".

<h4 id="security-risks-in-the-drag-and-drop-model">Security risks in the drag-and-drop model</h4>

  User agents must not make the data added to the {{DataTransfer}} object during the
  <code>dragstart</code> event available to scripts until the <code>drop</code> event, because
  otherwise, if a user were to drag sensitive information from one document to a second document,
  crossing a hostile third document in the process, the hostile document could intercept the data.

  For the same reason, user agents must consider a drop to be successful only if the user
  specifically ended the drag operation &mdash; if any scripts end the drag operation, it must be
  considered unsuccessful (canceled) and the <code>drop</code> event must not be fired.

  User agents should take care to not start drag-and-drop operations in response to script
  actions. For example, in a mouse-and-window environment, if a script moves a window while the
  user has his mouse button depressed, the user agent would not consider that to start a drag. This is
  important because otherwise user agents could cause data to be dragged from sensitive sources and
  dropped into hostile documents without the user's consent.

  User agents should filter potentially active (scripted) content (e.g., HTML) when it is dragged
  and when it is dropped, using a safelist of known-safe features. Similarly, <a>relative URLs</a>
  should be turned into absolute URLs to avoid references changing in unexpected ways. This
  specification does not specify how this is performed.

  <div class="example">
    Consider a hostile page providing some content and getting the user to select and drag and
    drop (or indeed, copy and paste) that content to a victim page's <{global/contenteditable}>
    region. If the browser does not ensure that only safe content is dragged, potentially unsafe
    content such as scripts and event handlers in the selection, once dropped (or pasted) into the
    victim site, get the privileges of the victim site. This would thus enable a cross-site
    scripting attack.
  </div>
