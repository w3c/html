<h2 id="browsers">Loading Web pages</h2>

  This section describes features that apply most directly to Web browsers. Having said that,
  except where specified otherwise, the requirements defined in this section <em>do</em> apply to
  all user agents, whether they are Web browsers or not.

<h3 id="sec-browsing-contexts">Browsing contexts</h3>

  A <dfn lt="browsing context|browsing contexts">browsing context</dfn> is an environment in which
  {{Document}} objects are presented to the user.

  <p class="note">
    A tab or window in a Web browser typically contains a <a>browsing context</a>, as
    does an <{iframe}> or <{frame}>s in a <{frameset}>.
  </p>

  A <a>browsing context</a> has a corresponding {{WindowProxy}} object.

  A <a>browsing context</a> has a <a>session history</a>, which lists the
  {{Document}} objects that the <a>browsing context</a> has presented, is
  presenting, or will present. At any time, one {{Document}} in each <a>browsing context</a>
  is designated the <dfn>active document</dfn>. A {{Document}}'s
  <a>browsing context</a> is that <a>browsing context</a> whose <a>session
  history</a> contains the {{Document}}, if any. (A {{Document}} created using
  an API such as {{DOMImplementation/createDocument()}} has no
  <a>browsing context</a>.) Each {{Document}} in a <a>browsing context</a> is
  <dfn lt="document associated with a window">associated</dfn> with
  a {{Window}} object.

  <p class="note">
  In general, there is a 1-to-1 mapping from the {{Window}} object to the
  {{Document}} object. There are two exceptions. First, a {{Window}} can be reused
  for the presentation of a second {{Document}} in the same <a>browsing context</a>,
  such that the mapping is then 1-to-2. This occurs when a <a>browsing context</a> is
  <a>navigated</a> from the initial <code>about:blank</code> {{Document}}
  to another, with <a>replacement enabled</a>. Second, a {{Document}} can end up
  being reused for several {{Window}} objects when the {{Document/open()|document.open()}} method is
  used, such that the mapping is then many-to-1.</p>

  <p class="note">A {{Document}} does not necessarily have a <a>browsing context</a>
  associated with it. In particular, data mining tools are likely to never instantiate browsing
  contexts.</p>

  <hr />

  A <a>browsing context</a> can have a <dfn>creator browsing context</dfn>, the
  <a>browsing context</a> that was responsible for its creation. If a <a>browsing context</a> has a
  <a>parent browsing context</a>, then that is its <a>creator browsing context</a>. Otherwise, if
  the <a>browsing context</a> has an <a>opener browsing context</a>, then <em>that</em> is its
  <a>creator browsing context</a>. Otherwise, the <a>browsing context</a> has no
  <a>creator browsing context</a>.

  <p>If a [=browsing context=] <var>context</var> has a [=creator browsing context=]
  <var>creator</var>, it also has the following properties. In what follows, let
  <var>creator document</var> be <var>creator</var>'s [=active document=] at the time
  <var>context</var> is created:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><dfn>creator origin</dfn></dt>
   <dd>|creator document|'s [=concept/origin=]</dd>

   <dt><dfn>creator URL</dfn></dt>
   <dd>|creator document|'s [=document url|URL=]</dd>

   <dt><dfn>creator base URL</dfn></dt>
   <dd>|creator document|'s [=base URL=]</dd>

   <dt><dfn>creator referrer policy</dfn></dt>
   <dd>|creator document|'s [=referrer policy=]</dd>

   <dt><dfn>creator context security</dfn></dt>

  To <dfn lt="creating a new browsing context|create a new browsing context">create a new browsing context</dfn>:

  1. Call the JavaScript <a>InitializeHostDefinedRealm</a>() abstract operation with the following
      customizations:
      * For the global object, create a new {{Window}} object <var>window</var>.
      * For the global <em>this</em> value, create a new {{WindowProxy}} object
         <var>windowProxy</var>, whose [[{{Window}}]] internal slot value is <var>window</var>.

         <p class="note">The internal slot value is updated when navigations occur.</p>
      * Let <var>realm execution context</var> be the created <a>JavaScript execution context</a>.
  1. Set the new <a>browsing context</a>'s associated {{WindowProxy}} to <var>windowProxy</var>.
  1. Let <var>document</var> be a new {{Document}}, whose [=url/URL=] is
      <a scheme>about:blank</a>, which is marked as being an <a>HTML document</a>, whose
      <a>character encoding</a> is UTF-8, and which is both [=ready for post-load tasks=] and
      <a>completely loaded</a> immediately.
  1. Set the [=concept/origin=] of <var>document</var>:
      * If the new <a>browsing context</a> has a <a>creator browsing context</a>, then the
         [=concept/origin=] of <var>document</var> is the <a>creator origin</a>.
      * Otherwise, the [=concept/origin=] of <var>document</var> is a unique
         <a>opaque origin</a> assigned when the new <a>browsing context</a> is created.
  1. If the new <a>browsing context</a> has a <a>creator browsing context</a>, then set
             <var>document</var>'s <a>referrer</a> to the <a>creator URL</a>.
  1. If the new <a>browsing context</a> has a <a>creator browsing context</a>, then set
                 <var>document</var>'s <a>referrer policy</a> to the <a>creator referrer policy</a>.
  1. Ensure that <var>document</var> has a single child <{html}> node, which itself has two empty
      child nodes: a <{head}> element, and a <{body}> element.
  1. <a>Implement the sandboxing</a> for <var>document</var>.
  1. Add <var>document</var> to the new <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>session history</a>.
  1. Set <var>window</var>'s associated {{Document}} to <var>document</var>.
  1. <a>Set up a browsing context environment settings object</a> with
       <var>realm execution context</var>.

<h4 id="sec-nested-browsing-contexts"><dfn lt="nested browsing contexts|nested browsing context">Nested browsing contexts</dfn></h4>

  Certain elements (for example, <{iframe}> elements) can instantiate further <a>browsing contexts</a>. These are called nested browsing contexts. If a browsing context <var>P</var> has a
  {{Document}} <var>D</var> with an element <var>E</var> that nests
  another browsing context <var>C</var> inside it, then <var>C</var> is said to be
  <dfn lt="through which new document is nested|nested through">nested through</dfn> <var>D</var>, and <var>E</var> is said to be the <dfn>browsing context container</dfn> of <var>C</var>.
  If the <a>browsing context container</a> element <var>E</var> is in the <code>Document</code> <var>D</var>, then <var>P</var> is
  said to be the <dfn>parent browsing context</dfn> of <var>C</var> and <var>C</var> is said to be a <dfn lt="child browsing context|child browsing contexts">child browsing context</dfn> of <var>P</var>.
  Otherwise, the <a>nested browsing context</a> <var>C</var> has no <a>parent
  browsing context</a>.

  A browsing context <var>A</var> is said to be an <dfn lt="ancestor browsing context|ancestor">ancestor</dfn> of a browsing context <var>B</var> if there exists a browsing
  context <var>A'</var> that is a <a>child browsing context</a> of <var>A</var> and that is itself an <a>ancestor</a> of
  <var>B</var>, or if the browsing context <var>A</var> is the
  <a>parent browsing context</a> of <var>B</var>.

  A browsing context that is not a <a>nested browsing context</a> has no <a>parent
  browsing context</a>, and is the <dfn>top-level browsing context</dfn> of all the browsing
  contexts for which it is an <a>ancestor browsing context</a>.

  The transitive closure of <a>parent browsing contexts</a>
  for a <a>nested browsing context</a> gives the list of <a>ancestor browsing contexts</a>.

  The <dfn>list of the descendant browsing contexts</dfn> of a {{Document}} <var>d</var> is the (ordered) list returned by the following algorithm:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>list</var> be an empty list.</li>

    <li>

    For each <a>child browsing context</a> of <var>d</var> that is <a>nested through</a> an element
    that is in the <code>Document</code> <var>d</var>, in the <a>tree order</a> of the elements nesting those <a>browsing
    contexts</a>, run these substeps:

    <ol>

      <li>Append that <a>child browsing context</a> to the list <var>list</var>.

      <li>Append the <a>list of the descendant browsing contexts</a> of the <a>active
      document</a> of that <a>child browsing context</a> to the list <var>list</var>.</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    <li>Return the constructed <var>list</var>.</li>

  </ol>

  A {{Document}} is said to be <dfn>fully active</dfn> when it has a <a>browsing context</a> and it is the <a>active document</a> of
  that <a>browsing context</a>, and either its browsing context is a <a>top-level browsing context</a>, or it has a <a>parent browsing context</a> and the {{Document}}
  through which it is nested is itself <a>fully active</a>.

  Because they are nested through an element, <a>child browsing contexts</a> are always tied to a
  specific {{Document}} in their <a>parent browsing context</a>. User agents must not allow the user
  to interact with <a>child browsing contexts</a> of elements that are in {{Document}}s that are
  not themselves <a>fully active</a>.

  A <a>nested browsing context</a> can be put into a <dfn>delaying <code>load</code> events mode</dfn>. This is used when it is <a>navigated</a>, to <a>delay the load event</a> of the <a>browsing
  context container</a> before the new {{Document}} is created.

  The <dfn>document family</dfn> of a <a>browsing context</a> consists of the union of all
  the {{Document}} objects in that <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>session
  history</a> and the <a>document families</a> of all those
  {{Document}} objects. The <a>document family</a> of a {{Document}} object
  consists of the union of all the <a>document families</a> of the
  <a>browsing contexts</a> that are <a>nested through</a> the {{Document}} object.

  The <dfn>content document</dfn> of a [=browsing context container=] |container| is the result of
  the following algorithm:

  1. If |container|'s [=nested browsing context=] is null, then return null.
  2. Let |context| be |container|'s [=nested browsing context=].
  3. Let |document| be |context|'s [=active document=].
  4. If |document|'s [=concept/origin=] and the [=security/origin=] specified by the
      [=current settings object=] are not [=same origin-domain=], then return null.
  5. Return |document|.

  </dl>

  The <dfn attribute for="Window"><code>top</code></dfn> IDL attribute on the {{Window}} object
  of a {{Document}} in a <a>browsing context</a> <var>b</var> must return
  the {{WindowProxy}} object of its <a>top-level browsing context</a> (which would be
  its own {{WindowProxy}} object if it was a <a>top-level browsing context</a>
  itself), if it has one, or its own {{WindowProxy}} object otherwise (e.g., if it was a

  The <dfn attribute for="Window"><code>parent</code></dfn> IDL attribute on the {{Window}} object
  of a {{Document}} that has a <a>browsing context</a> <var>b</var> must return the {{WindowProxy}}
  object of the <a>parent browsing context</a>, if there is one (i.e., if <var>b</var> is a
  <a>child browsing context</a>), or the {{WindowProxy}} object of the <a>browsing context</a>
  <var>b</var> itself, otherwise (i.e., if it is a <a>top-level browsing context</a> or a detached
  <a>nested browsing context</a>).

  The <dfn attribute for="Window"><code>frameElement</code></dfn> IDL attribute, on getting, must

  6. Return <var>container</var>.

<h4 id="sec-auxiliary-browsing-contexts"><dfn lt="auxiliary browsing contexts|auxiliary browsing context">Auxiliary browsing contexts</dfn></h4>

  It is possible to create new browsing contexts that are related to a <a>top-level browsing
  context</a> without being nested through an element. Such browsing contexts are called <a>auxiliary browsing contexts</a>. Auxiliary browsing contexts
  are always <a>top-level browsing contexts</a>.

  An <a>auxiliary browsing context</a> has an <dfn>opener browsing context</dfn>, which is
  the <a>browsing context</a> from which the <a>auxiliary browsing context</a> was
  created.

<h5 id="navigating-auxiliary-browsing-contexts-in-the-dom">Navigating auxiliary browsing contexts in the DOM</h5>

  The <dfn attribute for="Window"><code>opener</code></dfn> IDL attribute on the {{Window}} object,

  current <a>browsing context</a> was created (its <a>opener browsing context</a>), if there is one,
  if it is still available, and if the current <a>browsing context</a> has not

  On setting the {{Window/opener}} attribute, if the new value is null then the current

  the Property Descriptor {
  \[[Value]]: <var>value</var>, \[[Writable]]: true, \[[Enumerable]]: true,

  A <a>browsing context</a> <var>A</var> is <dfn lt="familiar with|familiar">familiar with</dfn> a second <a>browsing context</a> <var>B</var> if one of the following

  <p class="note">The relationship "<a>familiar with</a>" may be used to decide the value of a <a>browsing context name</a>, see the table in the following <a href="#browsing-context-names">browsing context names</a> section for details.</p>

  <hr />

  A <a>browsing context</a> <var>A</var> is <dfn>allowed to navigate</dfn> a

  </ol>

  <hr />

  An element has a <dfn>browsing context scope origin</dfn> if its {{Document}}'s
  <a>browsing context</a> is a <a>top-level browsing context</a> or if all of its
  {{Document}}'s <a>ancestor browsing contexts</a>
  all have <a>active documents</a> whose [=concept/origin=] are the
  <a>same origin</a> as the element's <a>node document</a>'s [=concept/origin=]. If an
  element has a <a>browsing context scope origin</a>, then its value is the
  [=concept/origin=] of the element's <a>node document</a>.

<h4 id="groupings-of-browsing-contexts">Groupings of browsing contexts</h4>

  Each <a>browsing context</a> is defined as having a list of one or more
  <dfn>directly reachable browsing contexts</dfn>. These are:

  * The <a>browsing context</a> itself.
  * All the <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>child browsing contexts</a>.
  * The <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>parent browsing context</a>.
  * All the <a>browsing contexts</a> that have the <a>browsing context</a> as their
     <a>opener browsing context</a>.
  * The <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>opener browsing context</a>.

  The transitive closure of all the <a>browsing contexts</a> that are
  <a>directly reachable browsing contexts</a> forms a <dfn>unit of related browsing contexts</dfn>.

  Each <a>unit of related browsing contexts</a> is then further divided into the smallest number of
  groups such that every member of each group has an <a>active document</a> with an
  [=concept/origin=] that, through appropriate manipulation of the
  {{Document/domain|document.domain}} attribute, could be made to be <a>same origin-domain</a> with
  other members of the group, but could not be made the same as members of any other group. Each
  such group is a
  <dfn lt="units of related similar-origin browsing contexts|unit of related similar-origin browsing contexts">unit of related similar-origin browsing contexts</dfn>.

  <p class="note">There is also at most one <a>event loop</a> per
  <a>unit of related similar-origin browsing contexts</a> (though several
  <a>units of related similar-origin browsing contexts</a> can have a shared <a>event loop</a>).</p>

<h4 id="browsing-context-names">Browsing context names</h4>

  Browsing contexts can have a <dfn>browsing context name</dfn>. By default, a browsing context
  has no name (its name is not set).

  A <dfn>valid browsing context name</dfn> is any string with at least one character that does
  not start with a U+005F LOW LINE character. (Names starting with an underscore are reserved for
  special keywords.)

  A <dfn lt="valid browsing context names or keywords|valid browsing context name or keyword">valid browsing context name or keyword</dfn> is any string that is either a <a>valid
  browsing context name</a> or that is an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for one of:
  <code>_blank</code>, <code>_self</code>, <code>_parent</code>, or <code>_top</code>.

  These values have different meanings based on whether the page is sandboxed or not, as summarized
  in the following (non-normative) table. In this table, "current" means the <a>browsing context</a>
  that the link or script is in, "parent" means the <a>parent browsing context</a> of the one the
  link or script is in, "top" means the <a>top-level browsing context</a> of the one the link or
  script is in, "new" means a new <a>top-level browsing context</a> or
  <a>auxiliary browsing context</a> is to be created, subject to various user preferences and user
  agent policies, "none" means that nothing will happen, and "maybe new" means the same as "new" if
  the "<code>allow-popups</code>" keyword is also specified on the <{iframe/sandbox}> attribute
  (or if the user overrode the sandboxing), and the same as "none" otherwise.

  <small>Most of the restrictions on sandboxed browsing contexts are applied by
  other algorithms, e.g., the <a>navigation</a> algorithm, not <a>the rules
  for choosing a browsing context given a browsing context name</a> given below.</small>


  <hr />

  An algorithm is <dfn>allowed to show a popup</dfn> if any of the following conditions is
  true:

  <ul>

    <li>The <a>task</a> in which the algorithm is running is currently
    processing an <a>activation behavior</a> whose <code>click</code> event
    was <a>trusted</a>.</li>

    <li>

    The <a>task</a> in which the algorithm is running is currently
    running the event listener for a <a>trusted</a> event whose
    type is in the following list:

    <ul class="brief">
      <li><code>change</code></li>
      <li><code>click</code></li>
      <li><code>dblclick</code></li>
      <li><code>mouseup</code></li>
      <li><code>reset</code></li>
      <li><code>submit</code></li>
    </ul>

    </li>

    <li>

    The <a>task</a> in which the algorithm is running was <a>queued</a> by an algorithm that was <a>allowed to show a popup</a>,
    and the chain of such algorithms started within a user-agent defined timeframe.

    <p class="example">
  For example, if a user clicked a button, it might be acceptable for a popup
    to result from that after 4 seconds, but it would likely not be acceptable for a popup to result
    from that after 4 hours.
  </p>

    </li>

  </ul>

  <hr />

  <dfn>The rules for choosing a browsing context</dfn> as part of the execution of a task,
  from within a given browsing context <var>context</var>, for a <a>browsing context name</a> <var>name</var>,
  are as follows:

  <ol>

    <li>If <var>name</var> is the empty string or <code>_self</code>, then
    the chosen browsing context must be the current one.</li>

    <li>If <var>name</var> is <code>_parent</code>, then the chosen
    browsing context must be the <a><em>parent</em> browsing context</a> of the current one,
    unless there isn't one, in which case the chosen browsing context must be the current browsing
    context.</li>

    <li>If <var>name</var> is <code>_top</code>, then the chosen browsing
    context must be the <a>top-level browsing context</a> of the current one, if there is one,
    or else the current browsing context.</li>

    <li>If <var>name</var> is not <code>_blank</code> and there exists a
    browsing context whose <a lt="browsing context name">name</a> is the same as <var>name</var>,
    within the <a>unit of related browsing contexts</a>, then that browsing context must be the chosen
    one. If there are multiple matching browsing contexts, the user agent should select one in some
    arbitrary consistent manner, such as the most recently opened, most recently focused, or more
    closely related.</li>

    <p class="warning">This non-deterministic approach is likely to change in a future version of HTML.</p>

    <li>
    Otherwise, a new browsing context is being requested, and what happens depends on the user
    agent's configuration and abilities — it is determined by the rules given for the first
    applicable option from the following list:

    <dl class="switch">

      <dt>If the algorithm is not <a>allowed to show a popup</a> and the
      user agent has been configured to not show popups (i.e., the user agent has a "popup blocker"
      enabled)</dt>

      <dd>

      There is no chosen browsing context. The user agent may inform the user that a popup has
      been blocked.

      </dd>

      <dt><dfn lt="prevents content from creating new auxiliary browsing contexts"></dfn>If the current browsing context's <a>active document</a>'s
      <a>active sandboxing flag set</a> has the <a>sandboxed auxiliary navigation browsing
      context flag</a> set.</dt>

      <dd>

      Typically, there is no chosen browsing context.

      The user agent may offer to create a new <a>top-level browsing context</a> or reuse
      an existing <a>top-level browsing context</a>. If the user picks one of those options,
      then the designated browsing context must be the chosen one (the browsing context's name isn't
      set to the given browsing context name). The default behavior (if the user agent doesn't
      offer the option to the user, or if the user declines to allow a browsing context to be used)
      must be that there must not be a chosen browsing context.

      <p class="warning">If this case occurs, it means that an author has explicitly sandboxed the
      document that is trying to open a link.</p>

      </dd>

      <dt><dfn lt="causes the opener attribute to remain null"></dfn>If the user agent has been configured such that in this instance it will
      create a new browsing context, and the browsing context is being requested as part of
      <a>following a hyperlink</a> whose <a>link types</a> include the <{link/noreferrer}> keyword
      </dt>

      <dd>A new <a>top-level browsing context</a> must be created. If the given browsing
      context name is not <code>_blank</code>, then the new top-level browsing context's
      name must be the given browsing context name (otherwise, it has no name). The chosen browsing
      context must be this new browsing context. The creation of such a <a>browsing context</a>
      is <dfn>a new start for session storage</dfn>.

      <p class="note">
  If it is immediately <a>navigated</a>, then the
      navigation will be done with <a>replacement enabled</a>.
  </p></dd>

      <dt>If the user agent has been configured such that in this instance it will create a new
      browsing context, and the <{link/noreferrer}> keyword doesn't
      apply</dt>

      <dd>A new <a>auxiliary browsing context</a> must be created, with the <a>opener
      browsing context</a> being the current one. If the given browsing context name is not <code>_blank</code>, then the new auxiliary browsing context's name must be the given
      browsing context name (otherwise, it has no name). The chosen browsing context must be this new
      browsing context.

      <p class="note">
  If it is immediately <a>navigated</a>, then the
      navigation will be done with <a>replacement enabled</a>.
  </p></dd>

      <dt>If the user agent has been configured such that in this instance it will reuse the current
      browsing context</dt>

      <dd>The chosen browsing context is the current browsing context.</dd>

      <dt>If the user agent has been configured such that in this instance it will not find a
      browsing context</dt>

      <dd>There must not be a chosen browsing context.</dd>

    </dl>

    User agent implementors are encouraged to provide a way for users to configure the user agent
    to always reuse the current browsing context.

    <p>If the chosen browsing context picked above, if any, is a new browsing context, then:</p>

    <ol>
     <li><p>Let <var>flagSet</var> be the current browsing context's <a>active document</a>'s
     <a>active sandboxing flag set</a>.</p></li>

     <li><p>If <var>flagSet</var>'s <a>sandboxed navigation browsing context flag</a> is set,
     then the current browsing context must be set as the new browsing context's <a>one permitted
     sandboxed navigator</a>.</p></li>

     <li><p>If <var>flagSet</var>'s <a>sandbox propagates to auxiliary browsing contexts
     flag</a> is set, then all the flags that are set in <var>flagSet</var> must be set in the
     new browsing context's <a>popup sandboxing flag set</a>.</p></li>
    </ol>

   </li>

  </ol>

<h4 id="script-settings-for-browsing-contexts">Script settings for browsing contexts</h4>

  When the user agent is required to
  <dfn>set up a browsing context environment settings object</dfn>, given a JavaScript execution
  context <var>execution context</var>, it must run the following steps:

  1. Let <var>realm</var> be the value of <var>execution context</var>'s Realm component.
  2. Let <var>window</var> be <var>realm</var>'s <a>global object</a>.
  3. Let <var>url</var> be a copy of the [=url/URL=] of the {{Document}} with which

<h3 id="security-infrastructure-for-window-windowproxy-location">Security infrastructure for <code>Window</code>, <code>WindowProxy</code>, and {{Location}} objects</h3>

  Although typically objects cannot be accessed across origins, the web platform would not be true
  to itself if it did not have some legacy exceptions to that rule that the web depends upon.

<h4 id="integration-with-idl">Integration with IDL</h4>

  When <a>perform a security check</a> is invoked, with a <var>platformObject</var>,
  <var>realm</var>, <var>identifier</var>, and <var>type</var>, run these steps:

  1. If <var>platformObject</var> is a {{Window}} or {{Location}} object, then:
      1. Repeat for each <var>e</var> that is an element of
          <a>CrossOriginProperties</a>(<var>platformObject</var>):
          1. If <a>SameValue</a>(<var>e</var>.\[[Property]], <var>identifier</var>) is true, then:
              1. If <var>type</var> is "<code>method</code>" and <var>e</var> has neither
                  \[[NeedsGet]] nor \[[NeedsSet]], then return.
              2. Otherwise, if <var>type</var> is "<code>getter</code>" and
                  <var>e</var>.\[[NeedsGet]] is true, then return.
              3. Otherwise, if <var>type</var> is "<code>setter</code>" and
                  <var>e</var>.\[[NeedsSet]] is true, then return.
  2. If <a>IsPlatformObjectSameOrigin</a>(<var>platformObject</var>) is false, then throw a
      "{{SecurityError}}" {{DOMException}}.

<h4 id="shared-internal-slot-crossoriginpropertydescriptormap">Shared internal slot: \[[CrossOriginPropertyDescriptorMap]]</h4>

  {{Window}} and {{Location}} objects both have a [[<dfn>CrossOriginPropertyDescriptorMap</dfn>]]
  internal slot, whose value is initially an empty map.

  <p class="note">The [[<a>CrossOriginPropertyDescriptorMap</a>]] internal slot contains a map with
  entries whose keys are (currentOrigin, objectOrigin, propertyKey)-tuples and values are property
  descriptors, as a memoization of what is visible to scripts when currentOrigin inspects a
  {{Window}} or {{Location}} object from objectOrigin. It is filled lazily by
  <a>CrossOriginGetOwnPropertyHelper</a>, which consults it on future lookups.</p>

  User agents should allow a value held in the map to be garbage collected along with its
  corresponding key when nothing holds a reference to any part of the value. That is, as long as
  garbage collection is not observable.

  <div class="example">
  For example, with
  <pre highlight="javascript">const href = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(crossOriginLocation, "href").set</pre>
  the value and its corresponding key in the map cannot be garbage collected as that would be
  observable.
  </div>

  User agents may have an optimization whereby they remove key-value pairs from the map when
  {{Document/domain|document.domain}} is set. This is not observable as
  {{Document/domain|document.domain}} cannot revisit an earlier value.

  <div class="example">
  For example, setting {{Document/domain|document.domain}} to "<code>example.com</code>" on
  <code>www.example.com</code> means user agents can remove all key-value pairs from the map where
  part of the key is <code>www.example.com</code>, as that can never be part of the origin again and
  therefore the corresponding value could never be retrieved from the map.

  The <dfn method for="Window"><code>open()</code></dfn> method on <code>Window</code> objects
  provides a mechanism for <a>navigating</a> an existing <a>browsing
  context</a> or opening and navigating an <a>auxiliary browsing context</a>.

  When the method is invoked, the user agent must run the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>entry settings</var> be the <a>entry settings object</a> when the method
    was invoked.</li>

    <li>Let <var>url</var> be the first argument.</li>

    <li>Let <var>target</var> be the second argument.</li>

    <li>Let <var>features</var> be the third argument.</li>

    <li>Let <var>replace</var> be the fourth argument.</li>

    <li>Let <var>source browsing context</var> be the <a>responsible browsing context</a>
    specified by <var>entry settings</var>.</li>

    <li>If <var>target</var> is the empty string, let it be the string "<code>_blank</code>" instead.</li>

    <li>

    If the user has indicated a preference for which <a>browsing context</a> to navigate,
    follow these substeps:

    <ol>

      <li>Let <var>target browsing context</var> be the <a>browsing context</a> indicated by
      the user.</li>

      <li>If <var>target browsing context</var> is a new <a>top-level browsing context</a>,
      let the <var>source browsing context</var> be set as <var>target browsing context</var>'s
      <a>one permitted sandboxed navigator</a>.</li>

    </ol>

    <p class="example">
  For example, suppose there is a user agent that supports control-clicking a
    link to open it in a new tab. If a user clicks in that user agent on an element whose <code>onclick</code> handler uses the <code>window.open()</code> API to open a page in an iframe, but, while doing so,
    holds the control key down, the user agent could override the selection of the target browsing
    context to instead target a new tab.

    If this does not result in a chosen browsing context,
    then throw an {{InvalidAccessError}} exception and abort these steps.
    Otherwise, let <var>target browsing context</var> be the <a>browsing context</a> so
    obtained.

    </li>

    <li>If <var>target browsing context</var> was just created, either as part of <a>the rules
    for choosing a browsing context</a> given a browsing context name or due to the user
    indicating a preference for navigating a new <a>top-level browsing context</a>, then let
    <var>new</var> be true. Otherwise, let it be false.</li>

    <li>Interpret <var>features</var> as defined in the CSSOM View specification. [[!CSSOM-VIEW]]</li>

      <dd>Jump to the step labeled <i>end</i>.</dd>

      <dd>Let <var>resource</var> be the [=url/URL=] "<code>about:blank</code>".</dd>

    Otherwise, <a>parse</a> <var>url</var> relative to <var>entry settings</var>, and let

    the <a>resulting URL record</a>, if any. If the <a>parse a URL</a> algorithm
    failed, then run one of the following two steps instead:

      <li>Let <var>resource</var> be a resource representing an inline error page.</li>

      <li>If <var>new</var> is false, jump to the step labeled <i>end</i>, otherwise, let
      <var>resource</var> be the [=url/URL=] "<code>about:blank</code>".</li>

    </ul>

    </li>

    <li>

    If <var>resource</var> is "<code>about:blank</code>" and <var>new</var> is true, <a>queue

<h4 id="garbage-collection-and-browsing-contexts">Garbage collection and browsing contexts</h4>

  A <a>browsing context</a> has a strong reference to each of its {{Document}}s

  A {{Document}} has a strong reference to its <code>Window</code> object.

  <p class="note">A <code>Window</code> object has a strong reference to its {{Document}} object through its <code>document</code> attribute. Thus, references from other scripts to either of

  <code>WindowProxy</code> object.
  </p>

  Each [=concept/script=] has a strong reference to its <a>settings

  When a <a>browsing context</a> is to <dfn lt="discard the document|discard a document">discard a <code>Document</code></dfn>, the user

<h4 id="browser-interface-elements">Browser interface elements</h4>

  To allow Web pages to integrate with Web browsers, certain Web browser interface elements are

  the user interface element that the object represents, as described below.

  The following <code>BarProp</code> objects exist for each {{Document}} object in a
  <a>browsing context</a>. Some of the user interface elements represented by these objects
  might have no equivalent in some user agents; for those user agents, except when otherwise

    corresponding user interface element was absent (i.e., its <code>visible</code> attribute may return false).</dd>

    <dt><dfn>The toolbar <code>BarProp</code> object</dfn></dt>

    <dd>Represents the user interface element found immediately above or before the document, as

  A <dfn interface><code>WindowProxy</code></dfn> is an exotic object that wraps a {{Window}}
  ordinary object, indirecting most operations through to the wrapped object. Each
  <a>browsing context</a> has an associated {{WindowProxy}} object. When the <a>browsing context</a>
  is <a>navigated</a>, the {{Window}} object wrapped by the <a>browsing context</a>'s associated
  {{WindowProxy}} object is changed.

  There is no {{WindowProxy}} interface object.

  Every {{WindowProxy}} object has a [[<dfn lt="window slot">Window</dfn>]] internal slot
  representing the wrapped {{Window}} object.

  <p class="note">Although {{WindowProxy}} is named as a "proxy", it does not do polymorphic
  dispatch on its target's internal methods as a real proxy would, due to a desire to reuse
  machinery between {{WindowProxy}} and {{Location}} objects. As long as the {{Window}} object
  remains an ordinary object this is unobservable and can be implemented either way.</p>

  <div class="example">
    In the following example, the variable <var>x</var> is set to the {{WindowProxy}} object
    returned by the {{Window/window}} accessor on the <a>global object</a>. All of the
    expressions following the assignment return true, because the {{WindowProxy}} object passes
    most operations through to the underlying ordinary {{Window}} object.

    <pre highlight="javascript">
      var x = window;
      x instanceof Window; // true
      x === this; // true
    </pre>
  </div>

<h3 id="section-origin">Origin</h3>

  Origins are the fundamental currency of the Web's security model. Two actors in the Web
  platform that share an origin are assumed to trust each other and to have the same authority.
  Actors with differing origins are considered potentially hostile versus each other, and are
  isolated from each other to varying degrees.

  <p class="example">For example, if Example Bank's Web site, hosted at
  <code>bank.example.com</code>, tries to examine the DOM of Example Charity's Web site, hosted at
  <code>charity.example.org</code>, a "{{SecurityError}}" {{DOMException}} will be raised.

  An <dfn for="concept" lt="cross-origin|origin|origins">origin</dfn> is one of the following:

  : An <dfn>opaque origin</dfn>
  :: An internal value, with no serialisation, for which the only meaningful operation is testing
      for equality.

  : A <dfn lt="tuple origin|tuple">tuple origin</dfn>
  :: A <a>tuple</a> consists of:

      * A <dfn lt="origin scheme">scheme</dfn> (a [=url/scheme=]).
      * A <dfn lt="origin host">host</dfn> (a <a for="url">host</a>).
      * A <dfn lt="origin port">port</dfn> (a <a for="url">port</a>).
      * A <dfn lt="origin domain">domain</dfn> (null or a <a for="url">domain</a>). Null unless
          stated otherwise.

  <p class="note">Origins can be shared, e.g., among multiple {{Document}} objects. Furthermore,
  <a for="concept">origins</a> are generally immutable. Only the <a lt="origin domain">domain</a> of a
  <a>tuple origin</a> can be changed, and only through the {{Document/domain|document.domain}} API.

<h3 id="sandboxing">Sandboxing</h3>

  A <dfn>sandboxing flag set</dfn> is a set of zero or more of the following flags, which are
  used to restrict the abilities that potentially untrusted resources have:

  <dl>

    <dt>The <dfn>sandboxed navigation browsing context flag</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    This flag <a lt="navigating">prevents content from navigating browsing contexts other

    <a>top-level browsing context</a> (which is protected by the <a>sandboxed top-level
    navigation browsing context flag</a> defined below).

    If the <a>sandboxed auxiliary navigation browsing context flag</a> is not set, then in
    certain cases the restrictions nonetheless allow popups (new <a>top-level browsing contexts</a>) to be opened. These <a>browsing contexts</a> always have <dfn>one permitted sandboxed navigator</dfn>, set
    when the browsing context is created, which allows the <a>browsing context</a> that
    created them to actually navigate them. (Otherwise, the <a>sandboxed navigation browsing
    context flag</a> would prevent them from being navigated even if they were opened.)

    </dd>

    <dt>The <dfn>sandboxed auxiliary navigation browsing context flag</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    This flag <a>prevents content from creating new auxiliary browsing contexts</a>,

    When the <a>sandboxed top-level navigation browsing context flag</a> is <em>not</em> set,
    content can navigate its <a>top-level browsing context</a>, but other <a>browsing contexts</a>

      <div class="note">
        The <code>allow-same-origin</code> keyword is intended for two cases.

        First, it can be used to allow content from the same site to be sandboxed to disable
        scripting, while still allowing access to the DOM of the sandboxed content.

        Second, it can be used to embed content from a third-party site, sandboxed to prevent that
        site from opening pop-up windows, etc, without preventing the embedded page from
        communicating back to its originating site, using the database APIs to store data, etc.

<h3 id="session-history-and-navigation">Session history and navigation</h3>

<h4 id="the-session-history-of-browsing-contexts">The session history of browsing contexts</h4>

  The sequence of {{Document}}s in a <a>browsing context</a> is its <dfn>session history</dfn>.
  Each <a>browsing context</a>, including <a>nested browsing contexts</a>, has a distinct
  session history. A <a>browsing context</a>'s session history consists of a flat list of
  <a>session history entries</a>. Each <dfn>session history entry</dfn> consists, at a minimum,
  of a [=url/URL=], and each entry may in addition have a <a>serialized state</a>, a title,
  a {{Document}} object, form data, a <a>scroll restoration mode</a>, a scroll position,
  and other information associated with it.

  <p class="note">
    Each entry, when first created, has a {{Document}}. However, when a {{Document}} is not
    <a lt="fully active">active</a>, it's possible for it to be <a>discarded</a> to free resources.
    The [=url/URL=] and other data in a <a>session history entry</a> is then used to bring a new
    {{Document}} into being to take the place of the original, should the user agent find
    itself having to reactivate that {{Document}}.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    Titles associated with <a>session history entries</a> need not have any relation with the
    current <{title}> of the {{Document}}. The title of a <a>session history entry</a> is intended
    to explain the state of the document at that point, so that the user can navigate the
    document's history.
  </p>

  URLs without associated <a>serialized state</a> are added to the
  session history as the user (or script) navigates from page to page.

  <hr />

  Each {{Document}} object in a <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>session history</a> is associated
  with a unique <code>History</code> object which must all model the same underlying
  <a>session history</a>.

  The <dfn attribute for="Window"><code>history</code></dfn> attribute of the <code>Window</code>
  interface must return the object implementing the <code>History</code>  interface for that
  {{Window}} object's newest {{Document}}.

  <hr />

  <p id="state-object">
    <dfn>Serialized state</dfn> is a serialization (via <a>StructuredSerializeForStorage</a>)
    of an object representing a user interface state. We sometimes informally refer to
    "state objects", which are the objects representing user interface state supplied by the
    author, or alternately the objects created by deserializing (via
    <a>StructuredDeserialize</a>) serialized state.
  </p>

  Pages can <a method for="History" lt="pushState()">add</a> <a>serialized state</a> to the
  session history. These are then <a>deserialized</a> and
  <a attribute for="WindowEventHandlers" lt="onpopstate">returned to the script</a> when the
  user (or script) goes back in the history, thus enabling authors to use the
  "navigation" metaphor even in one-page applications.

  <div class="note">
    <a>Serialized state</a> is intended to be used for two main purposes:
    first, storing a preparsed description of the state in the [=url/URL=] so that in the simple
    case an author doesn't have to do the parsing (though one would still need the parsing for
    handling <a for="url">URLs</a> passed around by users, so it's only a minor
    optimization), and second, so that the author can store state that one wouldn't store in the URL
    because it only applies to the current {{Document}} instance and it would have to be
    reconstructed if a new {{Document}} were opened.

    An example of the latter would be something like keeping track of the precise coordinate from
    which a pop-up <{div}> was made to animate, so that if the user goes back, it can be
    made to animate to the same location. Or alternatively, it could be used to keep a pointer into
    a cache of data that would be fetched from the server based on the information in the
    [=url/URL=], so that when going back and forward, the information doesn't have to be fetched
    again.
  </div>

  <hr />

  At any point, one of the entries in the session history is the <dfn>current entry</dfn>. This
  is the entry representing the <a>active document</a> of the <a>browsing context</a>.
  Which entry is the <a>current entry</a> is changed by the algorithms defined in this
  specification, e.g., during <a>session history traversal</a>.

  <p class="note">
    The <a>current entry</a> is usually an entry for the [=Document/URL=] of the
    {{Document}}. However, it can also be one of the entries for <a>serialized state</a> added
    to the history by that document.
  </p>

  <dfn>An entry with persisted user state</dfn> is one that also has user-agent defined state.
  This specification does not specify what kind of state can be stored.

  <p class="example">
    For example, some user agents might want to persist the scroll position, or the
    values of form controls.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    User agents that persist the value of form controls are encouraged to also persist their
    directionality (the value of the element's <{global/dir}> attribute).
    This prevents values from being displayed incorrectly after a history traversal when the user
    had originally entered the values with an explicit, non-default directionality.
  </p>

  An entry's <dfn>scroll restoration mode</dfn> indicates whether the user agent should restore the
  persisted scroll position (if any) when traversing to it. The scroll restoration
  mode may be one of the following:

  <dl>
    <dt>"<dfn value for="scrollRestorationMode"><code>auto</code></dfn>"</dt>
    <dd>The user agent is responsible for restoring the scroll position upon navigation.</dd>
    <dt>"<dfn value for="scrollRestorationMode"><code>manual</code></dfn>"</dt>
    <dd>
      The page is responsible for restoring the scroll position and the user agent does not
      attempt to do so automatically
    </dd>
  </dl>

  If unspecified, the <a>scroll restoration mode</a> of a new entry must
  be set to "<code>auto</code>".

  Entries that consist of <a>serialized state</a> share the same
  {{Document}} as the entry for the page that was active when they were added.

  Contiguous entries that differ just by <a for="url">fragment</a> also share the same {{Document}}.

  <p class="note">
    All entries that share the same {{Document}} (and that are therefore
    merely different states of one particular document) are contiguous by definition.
  </p>

  Each {{Document}} in a <a>browsing context</a> can also have a <dfn>latest entry</dfn>. This is
  the entry for that {{Document}} to which the <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>session history</a>
  was most recently traversed. When a {{Document}} is created, it initially has no
  <a>latest entry</a>.

  User agents may <a>discard</a> the {{Document}} objects of entries other than the
  <a>current entry</a> that are not referenced from any script, reloading the pages afresh when
  the user or script navigates back to such pages. This specification does not specify when
  user agents should discard {{Document}} objects and when they should cache them.

  Entries that have had their {{Document}} objects discarded must, for the purposes of
  the algorithms given below, act as if they had not. When the user or script navigates back or
  forwards to a page which has no in-memory DOM objects, any other entries that shared the same
  {{Document}} object with it must share the new object as well.

  The <dfn>joint session history</dfn> of a <a>top-level browsing context</a> is the union
  of all the <a>session histories</a> of all <a>browsing contexts</a> of all the <a>fully active</a>

  <a>current entry of the joint session history</a>.

  The <dfn>current entry of the joint session history</dfn> is the entry that most recently

  Entries in the <a>joint session history</a> are ordered chronologically by the time they

  entry has index 0, and the subsequent entries are numbered with consecutively increasing
  integers (1, 2, 3, etc).

  <p class="note">
    Since each {{Document}} in a <a>browsing context</a> might have a different <a>event loop</a>,
    the actual state of the <a>joint session history</a> can be somewhat nebulous. For example,
    two sibling <{iframe}> elements could both <a>traverse</a> from one unique origin to another
    at the same time, so their precise order might not be well-defined; similarly, since they

  The actual entries are not accessible from script.

  The <dfn attribute for="History"><code>scrollRestoration</code></dfn> attribute of the

  both getting and setting must instead throw a "{{SecurityError}}" {{DOMException}}.

  The <dfn attribute for="History"><code>state</code></dfn> attribute of the
  <code>History</code> interface, on getting, must return the last value it was set to by the user
  agent. If this <code>History</code> object is associated with a {{Document}} that is

  Initially, its value must be null.

  When the <dfn method for="History"><code>go(<var>delta</var>)</code></dfn> method is

  the user agent must <a>traverse the history by a delta</a> whose value is
  <var>delta</var> If this <code>History</code> object is associated with a {{Document}}

  "{{SecurityError}}" {{DOMException}}.

  When the <dfn method for="History"><code>back()</code></dfn> method is invoked, the user

  Each <a>top-level browsing context</a> has a <dfn>session history traversal queue</dfn>,
  initially empty, to which <a>tasks</a> can be added.

  Each <a>top-level browsing context</a>, when created, must begin running
  the following algorithm, known as the <dfn>session history event loop</dfn> for that
  <a>top-level browsing context</a>, <a>in parallel</a>:

  <ol>

    <li>Wait until this <a>top-level browsing context</a>'s
    <a>session history traversal queue</a> is not empty.</li>

    <li>Pull the first <a>task</a> from this <a>top-level browsing context</a>'s
    <a>session history traversal queue</a>, and execute it.</li>

    <li>Return to the first step of this algorithm.</li>

  </ol>

  The <a>session history event loop</a> helps coordinate cross-browsing-context transitions
  of the <a>joint session history</a>: since each <a>browsing context</a> might, at any
  particular time, have a different <a>event loop</a> (this can happen if the user agent has
  more than one <a>event loop</a> per <a>unit of related browsing contexts</a>),
  transitions would otherwise have to involve cross-event-loop synchronization.

  <hr />

  To <dfn lt="explicitly going back or forwards in the session history|traverse the history by a delta">traverse the history by a delta</dfn>
  <var>delta</var>, the user agent must append a <a>task</a> to this
  <a>top-level browsing context</a>'s <a>session history traversal queue</a>,
  the <a>task</a> consisting of running the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>If the index of the <a>current entry of the joint session history</a> plus <var>delta</var>
    is less than zero or greater than or equal to the number of items in the
    <a>joint session history</a>, then abort these steps.

    <li>Let <var>specified entry</var> be the entry in the <a>joint session history</a> whose
    index is the sum of <var>delta</var> and the index of the
    <a>current entry of the joint session history</a>.</li>

    <li>Let <var>specified browsing context</var> be the <a>browsing context</a> of
    the <var>specified entry</var>.</li>

    <li>If the <var>specified browsing context</var>'s <a>active document</a>'s
    <a>unload a document</a> algorithm is currently running, abort these steps.</li>

    <li>

    <a>Queue a task</a> that consists of running the following substeps. The relevant
    <a>event loop</a> is that of the <var>specified browsing context</var>'s <a>active document</a>.
    The <a>task source</a> for the queued task is the <a>history traversal task source</a>.

    <ol>

      <li>If there is an ongoing attempt to navigate <var>specified browsing context</var>
      that has not yet <a>matured</a> (i.e., it has not passed the point of making its {{Document}}
      the <a>active document</a>), then cancel that attempt to navigate the <a>browsing context</a>.
      </li>

      <li>

      If the <var>specified browsing context</var>'s <a>active document</a> is not the same
      {{Document}} as the {{Document}} of the <var>specified entry</var>, then run these substeps:

      <ol>

        <li><a>Prompt to unload</a> the <a>active document</a> of the
        <var>specified browsing context</var>. If the user
        <a>refused to allow the document to be unloaded</a>, then abort these steps.</li>

        <li><a>Unload</a> the <a>active document</a> of the <var>specified browsing context</var>
        with the <var>recycle</var> parameter set to false.</li>

      </ol>

      </li>

      <li><a>Traverse the history</a> of the <var>specified browsing context</var> to
      the <var>specified entry</var>.

    </ol>

    </li>

  </ol>

  When the user navigates through a <a>browsing context</a>, e.g., using a browser's back
  and forward buttons, the user agent must <a>traverse the history by a delta</a> equivalent
  to the action specified by the user.

  <hr />

  The <dfn method for="History" title="pushState(data, title, url)">pushState(any data, DOMString
  title, optional DOMString? url = null)</dfn> method adds a state object entry to the history.

  The <dfn method for="History" title="replaceState(data, title, url)">replaceState(any data,
  DOMString title, optional DOMString? url = null)</dfn> method updates the state object,
  title, and optionally the [=url/URL=] of the <a>current entry</a> in the history.

  When either of these methods is invoked, the user agent must run the following steps:

  1. If this {{History}} object is associated with a {{Document}} that is not <a>fully active</a>,
      throw a "{{SecurityError}}" {{DOMException}}.
  2. Optionally, abort these steps. (For example, the user agent might disallow calls to these
      methods that are invoked on a timer, or from event listeners that are not triggered in
      response to a clear user action, or that are invoked in rapid succession.)
  3. Let <var>targetRealm</var> be this {{History}} object's <a>relevant settings object</a>'s
      <a>Realm</a>.
  4. Let <var>serializedData</var> be a <a>StructuredSerialize</a>(<var>data</var>),
      <var>targetRealm</var>). Rethrow any exceptions.
  5. If the third argument is not null, run these substeps:
      1. <a>Parse</a> the value of the third argument, relative to the <a>entry settings object</a>.
      2. If that fails, throw a "{{SecurityError}}" {{DOMException}} and abort these steps.
      3. Let <var>new URL</var> be the <a>resulting URL record</a>.
      4. Compare <var>new URL</var> to the document's [=url/URL=]. If any component of
          these two <a>URL records</a> differ other than the <a>path</a>,
          <a for="url">query</a>, and <a for="url">fragment</a> components, then throw a
          "{{SecurityError}}" {{DOMException}} and abort these steps.
      5. If the <a for="url">origin</a> of <var>new URL</var> is not the same as the
          [=concept/origin=] of the <a>responsible document</a> specified by the
          <a>entry settings object</a>, and either the <a>path</a> or <a for="url">query</a>
          components of the two <a>URL records</a> compared in the previous step differ, throw a
          "{{SecurityError}}" {{DOMException}} and abort these steps. (This prevents
          sandboxed content from spoofing other pages on the same origin.)
  6. If the third argument is null, then let <var>new URL</var> be the [=url/URL=] of the
      <a>current entry</a>.
  7. If the method invoked was the {{History/pushState()}} method:
      1. Remove all the entries in the <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>session history</a> after the
          <a>current entry</a>. If the <a>current entry</a> is the last entry in the session
          history, then no entries are removed.

          <p class="note">This <a>doesn't necessarily have to affect</a> the user agent's user
          interface.</p>
      2. Remove any <a>tasks</a> queued by the <a>history traversal task source</a> that are
          associated with any {{Document}} objects in the <a>top-level browsing context</a>'s
          <a>document family</a>.
      3. If appropriate, update the <a>current entry</a> to reflect any state that the user agent
          wishes to persist. The entry is then said to be <a>an entry with persisted user state</a>.
      4. Add a <a>session history entry</a> entry to the session history, after the <a>current entry</a>,
          with <var>serializedData</var> as the <a>serialized state</a>, the given <var>title</var> as the
          title, <var>new URL</var> as the [=url/URL=] of the entry, and the
          <a>scroll restoration mode</a> of the current entry in the <a>session history</a> as the
          scroll restoration mode.
      5. Update the <a>current entry</a> to be this newly added entry.

      Otherwise, if the method invoked was the {{History/replaceState()}} method:

      1. Update the <a>current entry</a> in the session history so that <var>serializedData</var> is
          the entry's new <a>serialized state</a>, the given <var>title</var> is the new title, and
          <var>new URL</var> is the entry's new [=url/URL=].
  8. If the <a>current entry</a> in the session history represents a non-GET request (e.g., it was
      the result of a POST submission) then update it to instead represent a GET request.
  9. Set the document's [=url/URL=] to <var>new URL</var>.

      <p class="note">Since this is neither a <a>navigation</a> of the <a>browsing context</a> nor a
      <a>history traversal</a>, it does not cause a <code>hashchange</code> event to be fired.</p>
  10. Let <var>targetRealm</var> be this {{History}} object's <a>relevant settings object</a>'s
       <a>Realm</a>.
  11. Let <a>state</a> be <a>StructuredDeserialize</a>(<var>serializedData</var>,
      <var>targetRealm</var>). If this throws an exception, ignore the exception and set
      <var>state</var> to null.
  12. Set {{History/state|history.state}} to <a>state</a>.
  13. Let the <a>latest entry</a> of the {{Document}} of the <a>current entry</a> be the
       <a>current entry</a>.

  <p class="note">
    The <var>title</var> is purely advisory. User agents might use the title in the user interface.
  </p>

  User agents may limit the number of state objects added to the session history per page. If a
  page hits the user agent-defined limit, user agents must remove the entry immediately after the
  first entry for that {{Document}} object in the session history after having added the new
  entry. (Thus the state history acts as a FIFO buffer for eviction, but as a LIFO buffer for
  navigation.)

  <div class="example">
    Consider a game where the user can navigate along a line, such that the user is always at some
    coordinate, and such that the user can bookmark the page corresponding to a particular
    coordinate, to return to it later.

    A static page implementing the x=5 position in such a game could look like the following:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <!-- this is https://example.com/line?x=5 -->
      <title>Line Game - 5</title>
      <p>You are at coordinate 5 on the line.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="?x=6">Advance to 6</a> or
        <a href="?x=4">retreat to 4</a>?
      </p>
    </xmp>

    The problem with such a system is that each time the user clicks, the whole page has to be
    reloaded. Here instead is another way of doing it, using script:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <!-- this starts off as https://example.com/line?x=5 -->
      <title>Line Game - 5</title>
      <p>You are at coordinate <span>5</span> on the line.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="?x=6" onclick="go(1); return false;">Advance to 6</a> or
        <a href="?x=4" onclick="go(-1); return false;">retreat to 4</a>?
      </p>
      <script>
        var currentPage = 5; // prefilled by server
        function go(d) {
          setupPage(currentPage + d);
          history.pushState(currentPage, document.title, '?x=' + currentPage);
        }
        onpopstate = function(event) {
          setupPage(event.state);
        }
        function setupPage(page) {
          currentPage = page;
          document.title = 'Line Game - ' + currentPage;
          document.getElementById('coord').textContent = currentPage;
          document.links[0].href = '?x=' + (currentPage + 1);
          document.links[0].textContent = 'Advance to ' + (currentPage + 1);
          document.links[1].href = '?x=' + (currentPage - 1);
          document.links[1].textContent = 'retreat to ' + (currentPage - 1);
        }
      </script>
    </xmp>

    In systems without script, this still works like the previous example. However, users that
    <em>do</em> have script support can now navigate much faster, since there is no network access
    for the same experience. Furthermore, contrary to the experience the user would have with just a
    na&iuml;ve script-based approach, bookmarking and navigating the session history still work.

    In the example above, the <var>data</var> argument to the <code>pushState()</code> method is
    the same information as would be sent to the server, but in a more convenient form, so that the
    script doesn't have to parse the URL each time the user navigates.
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    Applications might not use the same title for a <a>session history entry</a> as the
    value of the document's <{title}> element at that time. For example, here is a simple
    page that shows a block in the <{title}> element. Clearly, when navigating backwards to
    a previous state the user does not go back in time, and therefore it would be inappropriate to
    put the time in the session history title.

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <!DOCTYPE html>

            }, 1000);
          var i = 1;

          function inc() {
            set(i + 1);
            history.pushState(i, 'Line - ' + i);
          }

          function set(newI) {
            i = newI;
            document.forms.F.I.value = newI;
          }
        </script>

      </body>
    </xmp>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    Most applications want to use the same <a>scroll restoration mode</a> value for all of
    their history entries. To achieve this they should set the <code>scrollRestoration</code>
    attribute as soon as possible (e.g., in the first <{script}> element in the
    document's <{head}> element) to ensure that any entry added to the history session gets the
    desired scroll restoration mode.

<h4 id="sec-implementation-notes-for-session-history"><dfn lt="doesn't necessarily have to affect|Implementation notes for session history">Implementation notes for session history</dfn></h4>

  <em>This section is non-normative</em>.

  The {{History}} interface is not meant to place restrictions on how implementations represent the
  session history to the user.

  For example, session history could be implemented in a tree-like manner, with each page having
  multiple "forward" pages. This specification doesn't define how the linear list of pages in the
  {{Window/history}} object are derived from the actual session history as seen from the user's
  perspective.

  Similarly, a page containing two <{iframe}>s has a {{Window/history}} object distinct from the
  <{iframe}>s' {{Window/history}} objects, despite the fact that typical Web browsers present the
  user with just one "Back" button, with a session history that interleaves the navigation of the
  two inner frames and the outer page.

  <em>Security</em>: It is suggested that to avoid letting a page "hijack" the history navigation
  facilities of a UA by abusing {{History/pushState()}}, the UA provide the user with a way to jump
  back to the previous page (rather than just going back to the previous state). For example, the
  back button could have a drop down showing just the pages in the session history, and not showing
  any of the states. Similarly, an aural browser could have two "back" commands, one that goes back
  to the previous state, and one that jumps straight back to the previous page.

  For both {{History/pushState()}} and {{History/replaceState()}}, user agents are encouraged to
  prevent abuse of these APIs via too-frequent calls or over-large state objects. As detailed above,
  the algorithm explicitly allows user agents to ignore any such calls when appropriate.

<h4 id="the-location-interface">The <code>Location</code> interface</h4>

  Each {{Window}} object is associated with a unique instance of a {{Location}} object, allocated
  when the {{Window}} object is created.

  To create a {{Location}} object, run these steps:

  1. Let <var>location</var> be a new {{Location}} <a>platform object</a>.
  2. Perform ! <var>location</var>.\[[DefineOwnProperty]]("<code>toString</code>", {
      \[[Value]]: <a>%ObjProto_toString%</a>, \[[Writable]]: false, \[[Enumerable]]: false,

  3. Perform ! <var>location</var>.\[[DefineOwnProperty]]("<code>toJSON</code>", {
      \[[Value]]: undefined, \[[Writable]]: false, \[[Enumerable]]: false,
      \[[Configurable]]: false }).
  4. Perform ! <var>location</var>.\[[DefineOwnProperty]]("<code>valueOf</code>", {
      \[[Value]]: <a>%ObjProto_valueOf%</a>, \[[Writable]]: false, \[[Enumerable]]: false,

  6. Set the value of the [[<a>DefaultProperties</a>]] internal slot of <var>location</var> to
      <var>location</var>.\[[OwnPropertyKeys]]().
  7. Return <var>location</var>.

  A {{Location}} object has an associated <dfn>relevant <code>Document</code></dfn>, which is this
  {{Location}} object's associated {{Document}} object's <a>browsing context</a>'s
  <a>active document</a>.

  A {{Location}} object has an associated <dfn for="Location">url</dfn>, which is this {{Location}}
  object's <a>relevant <code>Document</code></a>'s [=document url|URL=].

  A {{Location}} object has an associated <dfn>ancestor origins array</dfn>. When a {{Location}}
  object is created, its <a>ancestor origins array</a> must be set to a array created from the list
  of strings that the following steps would produce:

  1. Let <var>output</var> be an empty ordered list of strings.
  2. Let <var>current</var> be the <a>browsing context</a> of the {{Document}} with which the
      {{Location}} object is associated.
  3. <var>Loop</var>: If <var>current</var> has no <a>parent browsing context</a>, jump to
    the step labeled <var>End</var>.
  4. Let <var>current</var> be <var>current</var>'s <a>parent browsing context</a>.
  5. Append the <a>Unicode serialization</a> of <var>current</var>'s <a>active document</a>'s
      [=concept/origin=] to <var>output</var> as a new value.
  6. Return to the step labeled <var>Loop</var>.
  7. <var>End</var>: Return <var>output</var>.

  A {{Location}} object has an associated <dfn><code>Location</code>-object-setter navigate</dfn>
  algorithm, which given a <var>url</var>, runs these steps:

  1. If any of the following conditions are met, let <var>replacement flag</var> be unset;
      otherwise, let it be set:

      * This {{Location}} object's <a>relevant <code>Document</code></a> has
         <a>completely loaded</a>, or
      * In the <a>task</a> in which the algorithm is running, an <a>activation behavior</a> is
         currently being processed whose <code>click</code> event was <a>trusted</a>, or
      * In the <a>task</a> in which the algorithm is running, the event listener for a
         <a>trusted</a> <code>click</code> event is being handled.
  2. <a><code>Location</code>-object navigate</a>, given <var>url</var> and

  2. <a>Navigate</a> the <a>browsing context</a> to <var>url</var>, with the
      <a>exceptions enabled flag</a> set. Rethrow any exceptions.

      If the <var>replacement flag</var> is set or the <a>browsing context</a>'s
      <a>session history</a> contains only one {{Document}}, and that was the
      <a scheme><code>about:blank</code></a> {{Document}} created when the <a>browsing context</a> was created,
      then the navigation must be done with <a>replacement enabled</a>.

  The <dfn attribute for="Location"><code>href</code></dfn> attribute's getter must run these steps:

  1. If this {{Location}} object's <a>relevant <code>Document</code></a>'s

  methods (e.g., <a>HTTP POST</a>), the user agent should prompt the user to confirm the operation first,
  since otherwise transactions (e.g., purchases or database modifications) could be repeated. User
  agents may allow the user to explicitly override any caches when reloading. If <a>browsing
  context</a>'s <a>active document</a>'s <a>reload override flag</a> is set, then the
  user agent may instead perform <a>an overridden reload</a> rather than the navigation

<h3 id="browsing-the-web">Browsing the Web</h3>

<h4 id="navigating-across-documents">Navigating across documents</h4>

  Certain actions cause the <a>browsing context</a> to <i>navigate</i> to a new resource.
  A user agent may provide various ways for the user to explicitly cause a browsing
  context to navigate, in addition to those defined in this specification.

  <p class="example">
    For example, <a>following a hyperlink</a>, [[#forms-form-submission]], and the
    <code>window.open()</code> and <code>location.assign()</code> methods can all cause a
    browsing context to navigate.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    A <i>resource</i> has a URL, but that might not be the only information necessary
    to identify it. For example, a <a>form submission</a> that uses <a>HTTP POST</a> would also have the HTTP method
    and payload. Similarly, <a>an `iframe` `srcdoc` document</a> needs to know the data it is to use.
  </p>

  Navigation always involves <dfn>source browsing context</dfn>, which is the browsing context which
  was responsible for starting the navigation.

  When a browsing context is
  <dfn lt="navigated|navigate|navigation|navigating|navigation algorithm|navigating a browsing context|processing model for navigating across documents">navigated</dfn>
  to a new resource, the user agent must run the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>

    If the <a>source browsing context</a> is not <a>allowed to navigate</a> the
    <a>browsing context</a> being navigated, then abort these steps.

    If these steps are aborted here, the user agent may instead offer to open the new resource in
    a new <a>top-level browsing context</a> or in the <a>top-level browsing context</a>
    of the <a>source browsing context</a>, at the user's option, in which case the user agent
    must <a>navigate</a> that designated <a>top-level browsing context</a> to the new resource as
    if the user had requested it independently.

    <p class="note">
      Doing so, however, can be dangerous, as it means that the user is overriding the
      author's explicit request to sandbox the content.
    </p>

    If the <a>navigate</a> algorithm was invoked optionally with an
    <dfn>exceptions enabled flag</dfn>, and it is aborted on this step, then in addition to
    aborting this algorithm, the user agent must also throw a "{{SecurityError}}" {{DOMException}}.

    </li>

    <li>If there is a preexisting attempt to navigate the <a>browsing context</a>, and the
    <a>source browsing context</a> is the same as the <a>browsing context</a> being
    navigated, and that attempt is currently running the <a>unload a document</a> algorithm,
    and the [=concept/origin=] of the [=url/URL=] of the resource being loaded in
    that navigation is not the <a>same origin</a> as the [=concept/origin=] of the
    [=url/URL=] of the resource being loaded in <em>this</em> navigation, then abort these
    steps without affecting the preexisting attempt to navigate the <a>browsing context</a>.</li>

    <li>If a <a>task</a> queued by the <a>traverse the history by a
    delta</a> algorithm is running the <a>unload a document</a> algorithm for the
    <a>active document</a> of the <a>browsing context</a> being navigated, then abort
    these steps without affecting the <a>unload a document</a> algorithm or the aforementioned
    history traversal task.</li>

    <li>If the <a>prompt to unload a document</a> algorithm is being run for the
    <a>active document</a> of the <a>browsing context</a> being navigated, then abort
    these steps without affecting the <a>prompt to unload a document</a> algorithm.</li>

    <li>

    Let <var>gone async</var> be false.

    <p class="note">
      The <i>handle redirects</i> step later in this algorithm can in certain cases jump back to
      <a>the step labeled <var>Fragments</var></a>. Since, between those two steps, this algorithm
      goes from operating immediately in the context of the calling <a>task</a> to operating
      <a>in parallel</a> independent of the <a>event loop</a>, some of the intervening steps need
      to be able to handle both being run as part of a <a>task</a> and running <a>in parallel</a>.
      The <var>gone async</var> flag is thus used to make these steps aware of which mode they are
      operating in.
    </p>

    </li>

    <li><dfn lt="the step labeled fragments"><var>Fragments</var></dfn>: If this is not a
    <dfn>reload-triggered navigation</dfn>: apply the <a>URL parser</a> algorithm to the
    <a>absolute URL</a> of the new resource and the [=Document/URL=] of the <a>active document</a>
    of the <a>browsing context</a> being navigated; if all the components of the resulting
    <a>parsed URLs</a>, ignoring any <a for="url">fragment</a> components, are
    identical, and the new resource is to be fetched using <code>GET</code>, and the
    <a>URL record</a> of the new resource has a <a for="url">fragment</a> component that is not
    null (even if it is empty), then <a lt="navigate fragment">navigate to that fragment</a>
    and abort these steps.</li>

    <li>If <var>gone async</var> is false, cancel any preexisting but not yet <a>mature</a> attempt
    to navigate the <a>browsing context</a>, including canceling any instances of the <a>fetch</a>
    algorithm started by those attempts. If one of those attempts has already created and
    initialized a new {{Document}} object, <a>abort</a> that {{Document}} also. (Navigation
    attempts that have <a>matured</a> already have session history entries, and are therefore
    handled during the <a>update the session history with the new page</a> algorithm, later.)</li>

    <li>If the new resource is to be handled using a mechanism that does not affect the browsing
    context, e.g., ignoring the navigation request altogether because the specified scheme is not
    one of the supported protocols, then abort these steps and
    <a>proceed with that mechanism instead</a>.</li>

    <li>

    If <var>gone async</var> is false, <a>prompt to unload</a> the {{Document}} object.
    If the user <a>refused to allow the document to be unloaded</a>, then abort these steps.

    If this instance of the <a>navigation</a> algorithm gets canceled while this step is running,
    the <a>prompt to unload a document</a> algorithm must nonetheless be run to completion.

    </li>

    <li>If <var>gone async</var> is false, <a>abort</a> the <a>active document</a> of the
    <a>browsing context</a>.</li>

    <li>

    If the new resource is to be handled by displaying some sort of inline content, e.g., an error
    message because the specified scheme is not one of the supported protocols, or an inline prompt
    to allow the user to select <a>a registered handler</a> for the given scheme, then
    <a>display the inline content</a> and abort these steps.

    <p class="note">
      In the case of a registered handler being used, the algorithm will be reinvoked
      with a new URL to handle the request.
    </p>

    </li>

    <li>

    If the <a>browsing context</a> being navigated is a <a>nested browsing context</a>,
    then put it in the <a>delaying <code>load</code> events mode</a>.

    The user agent must take this <a>nested browsing context</a> out of the
    <a>delaying <code>load</code> events mode</a> when this <a>navigation</a> algorithm later
    matures, or when it terminates (whether due to having run all the steps, or being canceled,
    or being aborted), whichever happens first.

    </li>

    <li>

    This is the step that attempts to obtain the resource, if necessary. Jump to the first
    appropriate substep:

    <dl>

      <dt>If the resource has already been obtained (e.g., because it is being used to populate an
      <{object}> element's new <a>child browsing context</a>)</dt>

      <dd>Skip this step. The data is already available.</dd>

      <dt>If the new resource is a [=url/URL=] whose [=url/scheme=] is <code>javascript</code></dt>

      <dd>

      <a>Queue a task</a> to run
      <dfn lt="javascript: urls|javascript: url|dereferencing a javascript: url">these "<code>javascript:</code> URL" steps</dfn>,
      associated with the <a>active document</a> of the <a>browsing context</a> being navigated:

      1. If the [=concept/origin=] of the <a>source browsing context</a> is not the <a>same origin</a> as
          the [=concept/origin=] of the <a>active document</a> of the <a>browsing context</a> being
          navigated, then let <var>result</var> be undefined, and jump to the step labeled
          <i>process results</i> below.
      2. Let <var>urlRecord</var> be the result of running the <a>URL parser</a> on the
          [=url/URL=] of the new resource.
      3. Let <var>script source</var> be the empty string.
      4. Append the first string of <var>urlRecord</var>'s <a>path</a> component to <var>script
          source</var>.
      5. If <var>urlRecord</var>'s <a for="url">query</a> component is not null, then first
          append a U+003F QUESTION MARK character (?) to <var>script source</var>, and then append
          <var>urlRecord</var>'s <a for="url">query</a> component to <var>script source</var>.
      6. If <var>urlRecord</var>'s <a for="url">fragment</a> component is not null, then first
          append a U+0023 NUMBER SIGN character (#) to <var>script source</var>, and then append
          <var>urlRecord</var>'s <a for="url">fragment</a> component to <var>script
          source</var>.
      7. Replace <var>script source</var> with the result of applying the
          <a>percent decode</a> algorithm to <var>script source</var>.
      8. Replace <var>script source</var> with the result of applying the <a>UTF-8 decode</a>
          algorithm to <var>script source</var>.
      9. Let <var>address</var> be the [=Document/URL=] of the <a>active document</a> of the
          <a>browsing context</a> being navigated.
      10. Let <var>settings</var> be the <a>relevant settings object</a> of the <a>browsing
           context</a> being navigated.
      11. Let <var>script</var> be the result of <a>creating a classic script</a> given
           <var>script source</var> and <var>settings</var>.
      12. Let <var>result</var> be the result of <a>running the classic script</a>
           <var>script</var>. If evaluation was unsuccessful, let <var>result</var> be undefined
           instead. (The result will also be undefined if <a>scripting is disabled</a>.)
      13. <em>Process results</em>: If <a for="ecma">Type</a>(<var>result</var>) is not
           <code>String</code>, then the result of obtaining the resource for the URL is a
           <a>response</a> whose <a>status</a> is <code>204</code>.

           Otherwise, the result of obtaining the resource for the URL is a <a>response</a> whose
           [=response/header list=] consists of
           <code>Content-Type</code>/<code>[[#text-html|text/html]]</code> and whose
           [=response/body=] is <var>result</var>, and whose
           [=response/HTTPS state=] is <var>settings</var>'s
           <a for="settings">HTTPS state</a>.

           When it comes time to <a>set the document's address</a> in the
           <a>navigation algorithm</a>, use <var>address</var> as the <a>override URL</a>.

      The <a>task source</a> for this <a>task</a> is the <a>DOM manipulation task source</a>.

      <div class="example">
        So for example a <a><code>javascript:</code> URL</a> in an <{links/href}> attribute of
        an <{a}> element would only be evaluated when the link was followed, while such a URL in
        the <{iframe/src}> attribute of an <{iframe}> element would be evaluated in the context
        of the <code>iframe</code>'s own <a>nested browsing context</a> when the
        <code>iframe</code> is being set up; once evaluated, its return value (if it was not void)

    <li>Let <var>gone async</var> be true.</li>

    <li>Wait for one or more bytes to be available or for the user agent to establish that the
    resource in question is empty. During this time, the user agent may allow the user to cancel
    this navigation attempt or start other navigation attempts.</li>

    <li>

    <i>Handle redirects</i>: If fetching the resource results in a redirect, and either the
    [=url/URL=] of the target of the redirect has the <a>same origin</a> as the original
    resource, or the resource is being obtained using the POST method or a safe method (in HTTP
    terms), return to <a>the step labeled <var>Fragments</var></a> with the new resource, except
    that if the [=url/URL=] of the target of the redirect does not have a <a for="url">fragment</a>
    and the [=url/URL=] of the resource that led to the redirect does, then the
    <a for="url">fragment</a> of the resource that led to the redirect must be propagated to the
    [=url/URL=] of the target of the redirect.

    <p class="example">
      So for instance, if the original URL was "<code>https://example.com/#!sample</code>"
      and "<code>https://example.com/</code>" is found to redirect to
      "<code>https://example.com/</code>", the URL of the new resource will be
      "<code>https://example.com/#!sample</code>".
    </p>

    Otherwise, if fetching the resource results in a redirect but the [=url/URL=] of the
    target of the redirect does not have the <a>same origin</a> as the original resource and
    the resource is being obtained using a method that is neither the POST method nor a safe method
    (in HTTP terms), then abort these steps. The user agent may indicate to the user that the
    navigation has been aborted for security reasons.

    </li>

    <li>

    <i>Resource handling</i>: If the resource's out-of-band metadata (e.g., HTTP headers), not
    counting any <a>type information</a> (such as the Content-Type HTTP header), requires some
    sort of processing that will not affect the browsing context, then perform that processing
    and abort these steps.

    <div class="note">
      Such processing might be triggered by, amongst other things, the following:
      <ul class="brief">
        <li>HTTP status codes (e.g., 204 No Content or 205 Reset Content)</li>
        <li>Network errors (e.g., the network interface being unavailable)</li>
        <li>Cryptographic protocol failures (e.g., an incorrect TLS certificate)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    Responses with HTTP <a http-header><code>Content-Disposition</code></a> headers specifying
    the <code>attachment</code> disposition type must be handled <a>as a download</a>.

    HTTP 401 responses that do not include a challenge recognized by the user agent must be
    processed as if they had no challenge, e.g., rendering the entity body as if the response had
    been 200 OK.

    User agents may show the entity body of an HTTP 401 response even when the response does
    include a recognized challenge, with the option to login being included in a non-modal fashion,
    to enable the information provided by the server to be used by the user before authenticating.
    Similarly, user agents should allow the user to authenticate (in a non-modal fashion) against
    authentication challenges included in other responses such as HTTP 200 OK responses, effectively
    allowing resources to present HTTP login forms without requiring their use.

    </li>

    <li>Let <var>type</var> be the computed type of the resource.</li>

    <li>If the user agent has been configured to process resources of the given <var>type</var>
    using some mechanism other than rendering the content in a <a>browsing context</a>, then skip
    this step. Otherwise, if the <var>type</var> is one of the following types, jump to the
    appropriate entry in the following list, and process the resource as described there:

    would be said to explicitly support the <code>application/atom+xml</code> MIME type), or one for
    which the user agent has a dedicated handler.

      object and the resource used to generate the document. [[CSP3]]
  7. Set [=the document's referrer=] to the
      <em>address of the resource from which Request-URIs are obtained</em> as determined when the
      fetch algorithm obtained the resource, if that algorithm was used and determined such a value;
      otherwise, set it to the empty string.
  8. <a>Implement the sandboxing</a> for the {{Document}}.
  9. If the <a>active sandboxing flag set</a> of the {{Document}}'s <a>browsing context</a> or any
      of its <a>ancestor browsing contexts</a> (if any) have the
      <a>sandboxed fullscreen browsing context flag</a> set, then skip this step.

      If the {{Document}}'s <a>browsing context</a> has a <a>browsing context container</a> and
      either it is not an <{iframe}> element, or it does not have the <{iframe/allowfullscreen}>
      attribute specified, or its {{Document}} does not have the <a>fullscreen enabled flag</a> set,
      then also skip this step.

      Otherwise, set the {{Document}}'s <a>fullscreen enabled flag</a>.

    <li>

    <i>Non-document content</i>: If, given <var>type</var>, the new resource is to be handled by
    displaying some sort of inline content, e.g., a native rendering of the content, an error
    message because the specified type is not supported, or an inline prompt to allow the user
    to select <a>a registered handler</a> for the given type, then
    <a>display the inline content</a>, and then abort these steps.

    <p class="note">
      In the case of a registered handler being used, the algorithm will be reinvoked
      with a new URL to handle the request.
    </p>

    </li>

    <li>Otherwise, the document's <var>type</var> is such that the resource will not affect the
    browsing context, e.g., because the resource is to be handed to an external application or
    because it is an unknown type that will be processed <a>as a download</a>.

  When a resource is handled by <dfn lt="proceed with that mechanism instead|passing its URL or
  data to an external software package|process the resource appropriately">passing its URL or data
  to an external software package</dfn> separate from the user agent (e.g., handing a
  <code>mailto:</code> URL to a mail client, or a Word document to a word processor),
  user agents should attempt to mitigate the risk that this is an attempt to exploit the
  target software, e.g., by prompting the user to confirm that the <a>source browsing
  context</a>'s <a>active document</a>'s [=concept/origin=] is to be allowed to invoke the
  specified software. In particular, if the <a>navigate</a> algorithm, when it was invoked,
  was not <a>allowed to show a popup</a>, the user agent should not invoke the external
  software package without prior user confirmation.

  <p class="example">
    For example, there could be a vulnerability in the target software's URL
    handler which a hostile page would attempt to exploit by tricking a user into clicking a link.

  <ol>

    <li>

    If this instance of the <a>navigation</a> algorithm is canceled while this step is running
    the <a>unload a document</a> algorithm, then the <a>unload a document</a> algorithm must
    be allowed to run to completion, but this instance of the <a>navigation</a> algorithm must
    not run beyond this step. (In particular, for instance, the cancelation of this algorithm
    does not abort any event dispatch or script execution occurring as part of unloading the
    document or its descendants.)

  The <a>task source</a> for this <a>task</a> is the <a>networking task source</a>.

<h4 id="page-load-processing-model-for-html-files">Page load processing model for HTML files</h4>

  When an HTML document is to be loaded in a <a>browsing context</a>, the user agent must
  <a>queue a task</a> to create a {{Document}} object, mark it as being an <a>HTML document</a>,
  set its <a>content type</a> to "<code>[[#text-html|text/html]]</code>", initialize the
  {{Document}} object, and finally create an <a>HTML parser</a> and associate it with the
  {{Document}}. Each <a>task</a> that the <a>networking task source</a> places on the
  <a>task queue</a> while fetching runs must then fill the parser's <a>input byte stream</a>
  with the fetched bytes and cause the <a>HTML parser</a> to perform the
  appropriate processing of the input stream.

  <p class="note">
    The <a>input byte stream</a> converts bytes into characters for use in the
    [[#tokenization|tokenizer]]. This process relies, in part, on character encoding
    information found in the real <a>Content-Type metadata</a> of the
    resource; the "computed type" is not used for this purpose.
  </p>

  When no more bytes are available, the user agent must <a>queue a task</a> for the parser
  to process the implied EOF character, which eventually causes a <code>load</code> event
  to be fired.

  After creating the {{Document}} object, but before any script execution, certainly
  before the  parser <a lt="stop parsing">stops</a>, the user agent must
  <a>update the session history with the new page</a>.

  The <a>task source</a> for the two tasks mentioned in this section must be the
  <a>networking task source</a>.

<h4 id="page-load-processing-model-for-xml-files">Page load processing model for XML files</h4>

  When faced with displaying an XML file inline, user agents must follow the requirements
  defined in the XML and Namespaces in XML recommendations, RFC 7303, DOM, and other
  relevant specifications to create a {{Document}} object and a corresponding
  <a>XML parser</a>. [[!XML]] [[!XML-NAMES]] [[!RFC7303]] [[!DOM]]

  <p class="note">
    At the time of writing, the XML specification community had not actually yet
    specified how XML and the DOM interact.
  </p>

  After the {{Document}} is created, the user agent must initialize the {{Document}} object.

  The actual HTTP headers and other metadata, not the headers as mutated or implied by the
  algorithms given in this specification, are the ones that must be used when determining the
  character encoding according to the rules given in the above specifications. Once the character
  encoding is established, the <a>document's character encoding</a> must be set to that
  character encoding.

  User agents may examine the namespace of the root {{Element}} node of this
  {{Document}} object to perform namespace-based dispatch to alternative processing tools,
  e.g., determining that the content is actually a syndication feed and passing it to a
  feed handler. If such processing is to take place, abort the steps in this section, and
  jump to the next step (labeled <i>non-document content</i>) in the <a>navigate</a> steps above.

  Otherwise, then, with the newly created {{Document}}, the user agent must
  <a>update the session history with the new page</a>. User agents may do this before the
  complete document has been parsed (thus achieving <i>incremental rendering</i>), and must do
  this before any scripts are to be executed.

  Error messages from the parse process (e.g., XML namespace well-formedness errors) may be
  reported inline by mutating the {{Document}}.

<h4 id="page-load-processing-model-for-text-files"><dfn lt="plain text file">Page load processing model for text files</dfn></h4>

  When a plain text document is to be loaded in a <a>browsing context</a>, the user agent must
  <a>queue a task</a> to create a {{Document}} object, mark it as being an <a>HTML document</a>,
  set its <a>content type</a> to the <a>computed MIME type</a> of the
  resource (<var>type</var> in the <a>navigate</a> algorithm), initialize the
  {{Document}} object, create an <a>HTML parser</a>, associate it with the
  {{Document}}, act as if the tokenizer had emitted a start tag token with the tag name
  "pre" followed by a single U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character, and switch the <a>HTML parser</a>'s
  tokenizer to the [[#plaintext-state]]. Each <a>task</a> that
  the <a>networking task source</a> places on the <a>task queue</a> while fetching runs
  must then fill the parser's <a>input byte stream</a> with the fetched bytes and cause the
  <a>HTML parser</a> to perform the appropriate processing of the input stream.

  The rules for how to convert the bytes of the plain text document into actual characters, and
  the rules for actually rendering the text to the user, are defined by the specifications for the
  <a>computed MIME type</a> of the resource (<var>type</var> in the <a>navigate</a> algorithm).

  The <a>document's character encoding</a> must be set to the character encoding used to
  decode the document.

  When no more bytes are available, the user agent must <a>queue a task</a> for the parser
  to process the implied EOF character, which eventually causes a <code>load</code> event
  to be fired.

  After creating the {{Document}} object, but potentially before the page has finished
  parsing, the user agent must <a>update the session history with the new page</a>.

  User agents may add content to the <{head}> element of the {{Document}}, e.g.,
  to link to a style sheet, provide a script, give the document a <{title}>, etc.

  <p class="note">
    In particular, if the user agent supports the <code>Format=Flowed</code>
    feature of RFC3676 then the user agent would need to apply extra styling to
    cause the text to wrap correctly and to handle the quoting feature. [[RFC3676]]
  </p>

  The <a>task source</a> for the two tasks mentioned in this section must be the
  <a>networking task source</a>.

<h4 id="page-load-processing-model-for-multipartx-mixed-replace-resources">Page load processing model for <code>multipart/x-mixed-replace</code> resources</h4>

  When a resource with the type <code>multipart/x-mixed-replace</code> is to be loaded in a
  <a>browsing context</a>, the user agent must parse the resource using the rules for
  multipart types. [[!RFC2046]]

  For each body part obtained from the resource, the user agent must run a new instance of the
  <a>navigate</a> algorithm, starting from the <i>resource handling</i> step, using the new
  body part as the resource being navigated, with <a>replacement enabled</a> if a previous
  body part from the same resource resulted in a {{Document}} object being created and
  <a>initialized</a>, and otherwise using the same setup as the <a>navigate</a> attempt that
  caused this section to be invoked in the first place.

  For the purposes of algorithms processing these body parts as if they were complete stand-alone
  resources, the user agent must act as if there were no more bytes for those resources whenever the
  boundary following the body part is reached.

  <p class="note">
    Thus, <code>load</code> events (and for that matter <code>unload</code> events)
    do fire for each body part loaded.
  </p>

<h4 id="page-load-processing-model-for-media">Page load processing model for media</h4>

  When an image, video, or audio resource is to be loaded in a <a>browsing context</a>, the
  user agent should create a {{Document}} object, mark it as being an <a>HTML document</a>,
  set its <a>content type</a> to the <a>computed MIME type</a> of the resource (<var>type</var>
  in the <a>navigate</a> algorithm), initialize the {{Document}} object, append
  an <{html}> element to the {{Document}}, append a <{head}> element and
  a <{body}> element to the <{html}> element, append an element <var>host element</var>
  for the media, as described below, to the <{body}> element,
  and set the appropriate attribute of the element <var>host element</var>, as described
  below, to the address of the image, video, or audio resource.

  The element <var>host element</var> to create for the media is the element given in
  the table below in the second cell of the row whose first cell describes the media. The
  appropriate attribute to set is the one given by the third cell in that same row.

  <table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th> Type of media
      <th> Element for the media
      <th> Appropriate attribute
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td> Image
      <td> <code>img</code>
      <td> <code>src</code>
    <tr>

      <td> <code>src</code>
    <tr>
      <td> Audio
      <td> <code>audio</code>
      <td> <code>src</code>
  </table>

  Then, the user agent must act as if it had [=stop parsing|stopped parsing=].

  After creating the <code>Document</code> object, but potentially before the page has finished
  fully loading, the user agent must <a>update the session history with the new page</a>.

  User agents may add content to the <{head}> element of the {{Document}}, or attributes to the
  element <var>host element</var>, e.g., to link to a style sheet, provide a script, give the
  document a <{title}>, make the media <a element-attr for="media">autoplay</a>, etc.

<h4 id="page-load-processing-model-for-content-that-uses-plugins">Page load processing model for content that uses plugins</h4>

  When a resource that requires an external resource to be rendered is to be loaded in a
  <a>browsing context</a>, the user agent should create a {{Document}} object, mark
  it as being an <a>HTML document</a> and mark it as being a
  <dfn>plugin document</dfn>, set its <a>content type</a> to the <a>computed MIME type</a>
  of the resource (<var>type</var> in the <a>navigate</a> algorithm), initialize the
  {{Document}} object, append an <{html}> element to the {{Document}}, append a <{head}>
  element and a <{body}> element to the <{html}> element, append an <{embed}> to the
  <{body}> element, and set the <{embed/src}> attribute of the <code>embed</code> element
  to the address of the resource.

  <p class="note">
    The term <a>plugin document</a> is used by <cite>Content Security Policy</cite> as part of the
    mechanism that ensures <{iframe}>s can't be used to evade <code>plugin-types</code>
    directives. [[!CSP3]]
  </p>

  Then, the user agent must act as if it had [=stop parsing|stopped parsing=].

  After creating the <code>Document</code> object, but potentially before the page has finished
  fully loading, the user agent must <a>update the session history with the new page</a>.

  User agents may add content to the <{head}> element of the {{Document}}, or attributes to the
  <{embed}> element, e.g., to link to a style sheet, to give the document a <{title}>, etc.

  <p class="note">
    If the {{Document}}'s <a>active sandboxing flag set</a> has its

<h4 id="page-load-processing-model-for-inline-content-that-doesnt-have-a-dom"><dfn lt="display the inline content">Page load processing model for inline content that doesn't have a DOM</dfn></h4>

  When the user agent is to display a user agent page inline in a <a>browsing context</a>,
  the user agent should create a {{Document}} object, mark it as being an <a>HTML document</a>,
  set its <a>content type</a> to "<code>[[#text-html|text/html]]</code>",
  initialize the {{Document}} object, and then either associate that
  {{Document}} with a custom rendering that is not rendered using the normal
  {{Document}} rendering rules, or mutate that {{Document}} until it represents
  the content the user agent wants to render.

  Once the page has been set up, the user agent
  must act as if it had [=stop parsing|stopped parsing=].

  After creating the <code>Document</code> object, but potentially before
  the page has been completely set up, the user agent must
  <a>update the session history with the new page</a>.

<h4 id="navigating-to-a-fragment-identifier">Navigating to a <dfn lt="navigate fragment">fragment</dfn></h4>

  When a user agent is supposed to navigate to a fragment, then the user agent must run the
  following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>

    Remove all the entries in the <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>session history</a>
    after the <a>current entry</a>. If the <a>current entry</a> is the last entry in the
    session history, then no entries are removed.

    <p class="note">
      This <a>doesn't necessarily have to affect</a> the user agent's user interface.
    </p>

    </li>

    <li>Remove any <a>tasks</a> queued by the <a>history traversal
    task source</a> that are associated with any {{Document}} objects in the
    <a>top-level browsing context</a>'s <a>document family</a>.</li>

    <li>Append a new entry at the end of the <code>History</code> object representing the new
    resource and its {{Document}} object, related state, and current history scroll
    restoration preference. Its [=url/URL=] must be set to the address to which the user
    agent was <a>navigating</a>. The title must be left unset.</li>

    <li><a>Traverse the history</a> to the new entry, with the <i>non-blocking events</i>
    flag set. This will <a>scroll to the fragment</a> given in what is now the document's
    [=Document/URL=].</li>

  </ol>

  <p class="note">
    If the scrolling fails because the relevant <a>ID</a> has not yet been parsed, then the
    original <a>navigation</a> algorithm will take care of the scrolling instead, as the last
    few steps of its <a>update the session history with the new page</a> algorithm.
  </p>

  <hr />

  When the user agent is required to <dfn>scroll to the fragment</dfn> and <a>the
  indicated part of the document</a>, if any, is <a>being rendered</a>, the user agent must
  either change the scrolling position of the document using the following algorithm, or perform
  some other action such that <a>the indicated part of the document</a> is brought to the
  user's attention. If there is no indicated part, or if the indicated part is not <a>being
  rendered</a>, then the user agent must do nothing. The aforementioned algorithm is as follows:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>target</var> be <a>the indicated part of the document</a>, as defined below.</li>

    <li>If <var>target</var> is the top of the document, then
    <a spec="cssom-view">scroll to the beginning of the document</a> for the {{Document}},
    and abort these steps. [[!CSSOM-VIEW]]</li>

    <li>Use the <a spec="cssom-view">scroll an element into view</a> algorithm to scroll
    <var>target</var> into view, with the <var>align to top flag</var> set. [[!CSSOM-VIEW]]</li>

    <li>Run the <a>focusing steps</a> for that element, with the {{Document}}'s
    <a>viewport</a> as the <i>fallback target</i>.</li>

    <li>Move the <a>sequential focus navigation starting point</a> to <var>target</var>.</li>

  </ol>

  <dfn lt="an indicated part of the document|the indicated part of the document|indicated part of the document">The indicated part of the document</dfn>
  is the one that the <a for="url">fragment</a>, if any, identifies. The semantics of the
  <a for="url">fragment</a> in terms of mapping it to a specific DOM Node is defined by the
  specification that defines the <a>MIME type</a> used by the {{Document}} (for example, the
  processing of <a for="url">fragment</a> for <a>XML MIME types</a> is the responsibility of
  RFC7303). [[!RFC7303]]

  For HTML documents (and <a>HTML MIME types</a>), the following
  processing model must be followed to determine what <a>the indicated part of the document</a> is.

  <ol>

    <li>Apply the <a>URL parser</a> algorithm to the [=url/URL=], and let <var>fragid</var> be
    the <a for="url">fragment</a> component of the <a>resulting URL record</a>.</li>

    <li>If <var>fragid</var> is the empty string, then <a>the indicated part of the document</a>
    is the top of the document; stop the algorithm here.</li>

    <li>Let <var>fragid bytes</var> be the result of percent decoding <var>fragid</var>.</li>

    <li>Let <var>decoded fragid</var> be the result of running
    <a>UTF-8 decode without BOM or fail</a> on <var>fragid bytes</var>.
    If <var>decoded fragid</var> is failure, jump to the step labeled no

    <li>If there is an element in the DOM that has an <a>ID</a> exactly equal to
    <var>decoded fragid</var>, then the first such element in <a>tree order</a> is
    <a>the indicated part of the document</a>; stop the algorithm here.</li>

    <li><i>No decoded fragid</i>: If there is an <{a}> element in the DOM that has a
    <{a/name}> attribute whose value is exactly equal to <var>fragid</var>
    (<em>not</em> <var>decoded fragid</var>), then the first such element in <a>tree order</a>
    is <a>the indicated part of the document</a>; stop the algorithm here.</li>

    <li>If <var>fragid</var> is an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for the string

    <li>Otherwise, there is no <a>indicated part of the document</a>.</li>

  </ol>

  For the purposes of the interaction of HTML with Selectors' '':target'' <a>pseudo-class</a>, the
  <dfn>target element</dfn> is <a>the indicated part of the document</a>, if that is an element;
  otherwise there is no <a>target element</a>. [[!SELECTORS4]]

<h4 id="history-traversal">History traversal</h4>

  When a user agent is required to <dfn lt="traverse the history|history traversal|session history traversal|traversing the history">traverse the history</dfn>
  to a <var>specified entry</var>, optionally with <a>replacement enabled</a>, and optionally
  with the <i>non-blocking events</i> flag set, the user agent must act as follows.

  <p class="note">
    This algorithm is not just invoked when
    <a>explicitly going back or forwards in the session history</a> — it is also invoked in other

    <a>updating the session history with the new page</a>.
  </p>

  <ol>

    <li>

    If there is no longer a {{Document}} object for the entry in question, <a>navigate</a>

    The "<a>navigate</a>" algorithm reinvokes this "traverse" algorithm to complete the traversal,
    at which point there <em>is</em> a {{Document}} object and so this step gets skipped.
    The navigation must be done using the same <a>source browsing context</a> as was used the
    first time this entry was created. (This can never happen with <a>replacement enabled</a>.)

    <p class="note">

      be possible. In this case, the navigation will result in a different page than previously;
      for example, it might be an error message explaining the problem or offering to resubmit

  A {{Document}} has a <dfn><i>salvageable</i></dfn> state, which must initially be true, a
  <dfn>fired unload</dfn> flag, which must initially be false, and a <dfn>page showing</dfn>
  flag, which must initially be false. The <a>page showing</a> flag is used to ensure that
  scripts receive <code>pageshow</code> and <code>pagehide</code> events in a consistent manner
  (e.g., that they never receive two <code>pagehide</code> events in a row without an intervening
  <code>pageshow</code>, or vice versa).

  <a>Event loops</a> have a <dfn>termination nesting level</dfn> counter,
  which must initially be zero.

  When a user agent is to

  <code>navigator.onLine</code> attribute of a <code>Window</code> or
  <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code> changes from false to true, the user agent must
  <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>online</code> at
  the <code>Window</code> or <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code> object.

  The <a>task source</a> for these <a>tasks</a> is the <a>networking task source</a>.

  <p class="note">
    This attribute is inherently unreliable. A computer can be connected to a network
    without having Internet access.

  <div class="example">
    In this example, an indicator is updated as the browser goes online and offline.

    <xmp highlight="html">

            function updateIndicator() {
              document.getElementById('indicator').textContent = navigator.onLine ? 'online' : 'offline';
            }
          </script>

        <body onload="updateIndicator()" ononline="updateIndicator()" onoffline="updateIndicator()">
          <p>
            The network is:
