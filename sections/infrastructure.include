<h2 id="infrastructure">Common infrastructure</h2>

  <h3 id="infrastructure-terminology">Terminology</h3>

  This specification refers to both HTML and XML attributes and IDL attributes, often in the same
  context. When it is not clear which is being referred to, they are referred to as
  <a>content attributes</a> for HTML and XML attributes, and <dfn lt="IDL attribute|IDL attributes">IDL attributes</dfn> for those
  defined on IDL interfaces. Similarly, the term "properties" is used for both JavaScript object
  properties and CSS properties. When these are ambiguous they are qualified as
  <dfn lt="object property|object properties">object properties</dfn> and <dfn lt="CSS property|CSS properties">CSS properties</dfn> respectively.

  Generally, when the specification states that a feature applies to <a href="#syntax">the HTML syntax</a> or
  <a href="#xhtml">the XHTML syntax</a>, it also includes the other. When a feature specifically only applies to
  one of the two languages, it is called out by explicitly stating that it does not apply to the
  other format, as in "for HTML, ... (this does not apply to XHTML)".

  This specification uses the term <dfn lt="document|documents">document</dfn> to refer to any use of HTML, ranging from
  short static documents to long essays or reports with rich multimedia, as well as to fully-fledged
  interactive applications. The term is used to refer both to {{Document}} objects and
  their descendant DOM trees, and to serialized byte streams using the <a href="#syntax">HTML syntax</a> or
  <a href="#xhtml">XHTML syntax</a>, depending on context.

  In the context of the DOM structures, the terms <dfn>HTML document</dfn> and <a>XML document</a> are
  used as defined in the DOM specification, and refer specifically to two different modes that
  {{Document}} objects can find themselves in. [[!DOM]] (Such uses are always hyperlinked
  to their definition.)

  In the context of byte streams, the term <a>HTML document</a> refers to resources labeled as
  <a href="#text-html"><code>text/html</code></a>, and the term <dfn>XML document</dfn> refers to resources labeled with an
  <a>XML MIME type</a>.

  The term <dfn lt="XHTML document|XHTML documents">XHTML document</dfn> is used to refer to both <a>documents</a> in the
  <a>XML document</a> mode that contains element nodes in the <a>HTML namespace</a>, and byte
  streams labeled with an <a>XML MIME type</a> that contain elements from the <a>HTML namespace</a>,
  depending on context.

  <hr />

  For simplicity, terms such as <dfn>shown</dfn>, <dfn>displayed</dfn>, and <dfn>visible</dfn> might
  sometimes be used when referring to the way a document is rendered to the user. These terms are
  not meant to imply a visual medium; they must be considered to apply to other media in equivalent
  ways.

  <div class="impl">
    When an algorithm B says to return to another algorithm A, it implies that A called B. Upon
    returning to A, the implementation must continue from where it left off in calling B. Some
    algorithms run <dfn>in parallel</dfn>; this means that the algorithm's subsequent steps are to
    be run, one after another, at the same time as other logic in the specification (e.g. at the
    same time as the <a>event loop</a>). This specification does not define the precise mechanism by
    which this is achieved, be it time-sharing cooperative multitasking, fibers, threads, processes,
    using different hyperthreads, cores, CPUs, machines, etc. By contrast, an operation that is to
    run <dfn>immediately</dfn> must interrupt the currently running task, run itself, and then
    resume the previously running task.
  </div>

  The term "transparent black" refers to the color with red, green, blue, and alpha channels all set
  to zero.

<h4 id="resources">Resources</h4>

  The specification uses the term <dfn>supported</dfn> when referring to whether a user agent has an
  implementation capable of decoding the semantics of an external resource. A format or type is said
  to be <i>supported</i> if the implementation can process an external resource of that format or
  type without critical aspects of the resource being ignored. Whether a specific resource is
  <i>supported</i> can depend on what features of the resource's format are in use.

  <p class="example">
    For example, a PNG image would be considered to be in a supported format if its pixel data could
    be decoded and rendered, even if, unbeknownst to the implementation, the image also contained
    animation data.
  </p>

  <p class="example">
    An MPEG-4 video file would not be considered to be in a supported format if the compression
    format used was not supported, even if the implementation could determine the dimensions of the
    movie from the file's metadata.
  </p>

  What some specifications, in particular the HTTP specification, refer to as a
  <i>representation</i> is referred to in this specification as a <dfn for="http">resource</dfn>. [[!HTTP]]

  The term <dfn lt="mime type|mime types">MIME type</dfn> is used to refer to what is sometimes called an <i>Internet media
  type</i> in protocol literature. The term <dfn for="media type|media-type">media type</dfn> in this specification is used to refer
  to the type of media intended for presentation, as used by the CSS specifications. [[!RFC2046]]
  [[!MEDIAQ]]

  A string is a <dfn>valid MIME type</dfn> if it matches the <a><code>media-type</code></a> rule. In particular, a <a>valid mime type</a> may include
  MIME type parameters. [[!HTTP]]

  A string is a <dfn for="mime type" lt="valid MIME type with no parameters|valid MIME types with no parameters">valid MIME type with no parameters</dfn> if it matches the
  <a><code>media-type</code></a> rule, but does not
  contain any U+003B SEMICOLON characters (;). In other words, if it consists only of a type and
  subtype, with no MIME Type parameters. [[!HTTP]]

  The term <dfn>HTML MIME type</dfn> is used to refer to the <a>MIME type</a>
  <a href="#text-html"><code>text/html</code></a>.

  A resource's <dfn lt="critical subresource|critical subresources">critical subresources</dfn> are those that the resource needs to have available
  to be correctly processed. Which resources are considered critical or not is defined by the
  specification that defines the resource's format.

  The term <a scheme lt="data:"><code>data:</code> URL</a> refers to [[url#urls|URLs]] that use the <a scheme><code>data:</code></a>
  scheme. [[!RFC2397]]

<h4 id="xml">XML</h4>

  To ease migration from HTML to XHTML, user agents conforming to this specification will place elements in
  HTML in the <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code> namespace, at least for the purposes of the
  DOM and CSS. The term "<dfn lt="html element|html elements">HTML elements</dfn>", when used in this specification, refers to any
  element in that namespace, and thus refers to both HTML and XHTML elements.

  Except where otherwise stated, all elements defined or mentioned in this specification are in the
  <a>HTML namespace</a> ("<code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>"), and all attributes defined or
  mentioned in this specification have no namespace.

  The term <dfn>element type</dfn> is used to refer to the set of elements that have a given local
  name and namespace. For example, <{button}> elements are elements with the element type
  <{button}>, meaning they have the local name "<{button}>" and (implicitly as
  defined above) the <a>HTML namespace</a>.

  Attribute names are said to be <dfn for="xml-compatible">XML-compatible</dfn> if they match the
  <a spec="XML" for="XML"><code>Name</code></a> production defined in XML and they contain no U+003A COLON characters
  (:). [[!XML]]

  The term <dfn>XML MIME type</dfn> is used to refer to the <a>MIME types</a> <code>text/xml</code>,
  <code>application/xml</code>, and any <a>MIME type</a> whose subtype ends with the four characters
  "<code>+xml</code>". [[!RFC7303]]

<h4 id="dom-trees">DOM trees</h4>

  The <dfn for="document">root element of a {{Document}} object</dfn> is that {{Document}}'s
  first element child, if any. If it does not have one then the {{Document}} has no root
  element.

  The term <dfn lt="root element|root elements">root element</dfn>, when not referring to a {{Document}} object's root
  element, means the furthest ancestor element node of whatever node is being discussed, or the node
  itself if it has no ancestors. When the node is a part of the document, then the node's
  <a>root element</a> is indeed the document's root element; however, if the node is not currently
  part of the document tree, the root element will be an orphaned node.

  When an element's <a>root element</a> is the <a>root element of a <code>Document</code> object</a>,
  it is said to be <dfn lt="in the document|in a document">in a {{Document}}</dfn>. An element is said to have been
  <dfn for="document" lt="inserted into the document|inserted into a document|inserted into">inserted into a document</dfn> when its <a>root element</a> changes and is now the document's
  <a>root element</a>. Analogously, an element is said to have been
  <dfn for="document" lt="removed from a document|removed from">removed from a document</dfn> when its <a>root element</a> changes from being the document's
  <a>root element</a> to being another element.

  A node's <dfn lt="home subtree|home subtrees">home subtree</dfn> is the subtree rooted at that node's <a>root element</a>. When a
  node is <a>in a <code>Document</code></a>, its <a>home subtree</a> is that {{Document}}'s tree.

  The {{Document}} of a {{Node}} (such as an element) is the {{Document}}
  that the {{Node}}'s {{Node/ownerDocument}} IDL attribute returns. When a
  {{Node}} is <a>in a <code>Document</code></a> then that {{Document}} is
  always the {{Node}}'s {{Document}}, and the {{Node}}'s
  {{Node/ownerDocument}} IDL attribute thus always returns that {{Document}}.

  The {{Document}} of a content attribute is the {{Document}} of the attribute's
  element.

  The term <dfn>tree order</dfn> means a pre-order, depth-first traversal of DOM nodes involved
  (through the {{Node/parentNode}}/{{Node/childNodes}} relationship).

  When it is stated that some element or attribute is <dfn>ignored</dfn>, or treated as some other
  value, or handled as if it was something else, this refers only to the processing of the node
  after it is in the DOM. <span class="impl">A user agent must not mutate the DOM in such
  situations.</span>

  A content attribute is said to <dfn>change</dfn> value only if its new value is different than its
  previous value; setting an attribute to a value it already has does not change it.

  The term <dfn>empty</dfn>, when used of an attribute value, {{Text}} node, or string,
  means that the length of the text is zero (i.e. not even containing spaces or
  <a>control characters</a>).

  A <a for="Node" spec="dom" lt="insert">node <var>A</var> is
  inserted</a> into a node <var>B</var> when the
  <a>insertion steps</a> are invoked with <var>A</var> as the argument and <var>A</var>'s new parent
  is <var>B</var>. Similarly, a <dfn>node <var>A</var> is removed</dfn> from a node <var>B</var>
  when the <a>removing steps</a> are invoked with <var>A</var> as the <var>removedNode</var>
  argument and <var>B</var> as the <var>oldParent</var> argument.

<h4 id="scripting">Scripting</h4>

  The construction "a <code>Foo</code> object", where <code>Foo</code> is actually an interface,
  is sometimes used instead of the more accurate "an object implementing the interface
  <code>Foo</code>".

  An IDL attribute is said to be <dfn for="values">getting</dfn> when its value is being retrieved
  (e.g. by author script), and is said to be <dfn for="values">setting</dfn> when a new value is
  assigned to it.

  If a DOM object is said to be <dfn>live</dfn>, then the attributes and methods on that object
  <span class="impl">must</span> operate on the actual underlying data, not a snapshot of the
  data.

  In the contexts of events, the terms <i>fire</i> and <i>dispatch</i> are used as defined in the
  DOM specification: <dfn lt="fire|firing|fired|fires|fire a simple event|fires a simple event">firing</dfn> an event means to create and <a>dispatch</a> it, and
  <dfn lt="dispatch|dispatching|dispatched|dom event dispatch logic|event dispatching">dispatching</dfn> an event means to follow the steps that propagate the event through the
  tree. The term <dfn lt="trusted|trusted event">trusted event</dfn> is used to refer to events whose {{Event/isTrusted}}
  attribute is initialized to true. [[!DOM]]

<h4 id="plugin-content-handlers"><code>Plugin</code> Content Handlers</h4>

  The term <dfn lt="plugin|plugins">plugin</dfn> refers to a user-agent defined set of content handlers used by the user
  agent that can take part in the user agent's rendering of a {{Document}} object, but that
  neither act as <a>child browsing contexts</a> of the {{Document}} nor introduce any
  {{Node}} objects to the {{Document}}'s DOM.

  Typically such content handlers are provided by third parties, though a user agent can also
  designate built-in content handlers as <a>plugins</a>.

  <div class="impl">
    A user agent must not consider the types <code>text/plain</code> and
    <code>application/octet-stream</code> as having a registered <a>plugin</a>.
  </div>

  <p class="example">
    One example of a plugin would be a PDF viewer that is instantiated in a
    <a>browsing context</a> when the user navigates to a PDF file. This would count as a
    plugin regardless of whether the party that implemented the PDF viewer component was the same as
    that which implemented the user agent itself. However, a PDF viewer application that launches
    separate from the user agent (as opposed to using the same interface) is not a plugin by this
    definition.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    This specification does not define a mechanism for interacting with <a>plugins</a>, as it is expected
    to be user-agent- and platform-specific. Some user agents might opt to support a plugin mechanism such
    as the Netscape Plugin API; others might use remote content converters or have built-in support
    for certain types. Indeed, this specification doesn't require user agents to support <a>plugins</a> at
    all. [[NPAPI]]
  </p>

  A plugin can be <dfn>secured</dfn> if it honors the semantics of the <code>sandbox</code>
  attribute.

  <p class="example">
    For example, a secured plugin would prevent its contents from creating pop-up windows when the
    plugin is instantiated inside a sandboxed <{iframe}>.
  </p>

  <div class="impl">
    <p class="warning">
      Browsers should take extreme care when interacting with external content intended for
      <a>plugins</a>. When third-party software is run with the same privileges as the user agent
      itself, vulnerabilities in the third-party software become as dangerous as those in the user
      agent.
    </p>

    Since different users having different sets of <a>plugins</a> provides a fingerprinting vector
    that increases the chances of users being uniquely identified, user agents are encouraged to
    support the exact same set of <a>plugins</a> for each user.
    <a class="fingerprint" href="#fingerprinting-vector"><img height="21" src="images/fingerprint.png" width="15" alt="(This is a fingerprinting vector.)" /></a>
  </div>

<h4 id="encoding-terminology">Character encodings</h4>

  A <dfn lt="character encoding|character encodings">character encoding</dfn>, or just <i>encoding</i> where that is not ambiguous, is a defined
  way to convert between byte streams and Unicode strings, as defined in the Encoding standard. An
  <a spec="dom">encoding</a> has an <dfn>encoding name</dfn> and one or more <dfn>encoding labels</dfn>,
  referred to as the encoding's <i>name</i> and <i>labels</i> in the Encoding standard.
  [[!ENCODING]]

  An <dfn lt="ASCII-compatible encoding|ASCII-compatible character encoding">ASCII-compatible character encoding</dfn> is a single-byte or variable-length
  <a>encoding</a> in which the bytes 0x09, 0x0A, 0x0C, 0x0D, 0x20 - 0x22, 0x26, 0x27, 0x2C - 0x3F,
  0x41 - 0x5A, and 0x61 - 0x7A, ignoring bytes that are the second and later bytes of multibyte
  sequences, all correspond to single-byte sequences that map to the same Unicode characters as
  those bytes in Windows-1252. [[!ENCODING]]

  <p class="note">
    This includes such encodings as Shift_JIS, HZ-GB-2312, and variants of ISO-2022, even though it
    is possible in these encodings for bytes like 0x70 to be part of longer sequences that are
    unrelated to their interpretation as ASCII. It excludes UTF-16 variants, as well as obsolete
    legacy encodings such as UTF-7, GSM03.38, and EBCDIC variants.
  </p>

  The term <dfn lt="UTF-16 encoding|a UTF-16 encoding">a UTF-16 encoding</dfn> refers to any variant of UTF-16: UTF-16LE or UTF-16BE,
  regardless of the presence or absence of a BOM. [[!ENCODING]]

  The term <dfn lt="code unit|code units">code unit</dfn> is used as defined in the Web IDL specification: a 16 bit
  unsigned integer, the smallest atomic component of a <code>DOMString</code>. (This is a narrower
  definition than the one used in Unicode, and is not the same as a <i>code point</i>.) [[!WEBIDL]]

  The term <dfn lt="Unicode code point|Unicode code points">Unicode code point</dfn> means a <i>Unicode scalar value</i> where possible, and an
  isolated surrogate code point when not. When a conformance requirement is defined in terms of
  characters or Unicode code points, a pair of <a>code units</a> consisting of a high surrogate
  followed by a low surrogate must be treated as the single code point represented by the surrogate
  pair, but isolated surrogates must each be treated as the single code point with the value of the
  surrogate. [[!UNICODE]

  In this specification, the term <dfn lt="character|characters">character</dfn>, when not qualified as <em>Unicode</em>
  character, is synonymous with the term <a>Unicode code point</a>.

  The term <dfn lt="Unicode character|Unicode characters">Unicode character</dfn> is used to mean a <i>Unicode scalar value</i> (i.e. any
  Unicode code point that is not a surrogate code point). [[!UNICODE]]

  The <dfn>code-unit length</dfn> of a string is the number of <a>code units</a> in that string.

  <p class="note">
    This complexity results from the historical decision to define the DOM API in terms of 16 bit
    (UTF-16) <a>code units</a>, rather than in terms of <a>Unicode characters</a>.
  </p>

<h3 id="conformance-requirements">Conformance requirements</h3>

  All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative, as are all sections
  explicitly marked non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
  "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this document
  are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119. The key word "OPTIONALLY" in the normative parts of
  this document is to be interpreted with the same normative meaning as "MAY" and "OPTIONAL". For
  readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification.
  [[!RFC2119]]

  <div class="impl">
    Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as "strip any leading space
    characters" or "return false and abort these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of
    the key word ("must", "should", "may", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.

    <div class="example">
      For example, were the spec to say:

      <pre>
        To eat an orange, the user must:
        1. Peel the orange.
        2. Separate each slice of the orange.
        3. Eat the orange slices.
      </pre>

      ...it would be equivalent to the following:

      <pre>
        To eat an orange:
        1. The user must peel the orange.
        2. The user must separate each slice of the orange.
        3. The user must eat the orange slices.
      </pre>

      Here the key word is "must".

      The former (imperative) style is generally preferred in this specification for stylistic
      reasons.
    </div>

    Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any
    manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in this
    specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)
  </div>

<div class="impl">
  <h4 id="conformance-classes">Conformance classes</h4>

  This specification describes the conformance criteria for <span class="impl">user agents (relevant
  to implementors) and</span> documents<span class="impl"> (relevant to authors and authoring tool
  implementors)</span>.

  <dfn lt="conforming document|conforming documents">Conforming documents</dfn> are those that comply with all the conformance criteria for
  documents. For readability, some of these conformance requirements are phrased as conformance
  requirements on authors; such requirements are implicitly requirements on documents: by
  definition, all documents are assumed to have had an author. (In some cases, that author may
  itself be a user agent &mdash; such user agents are subject to additional rules, as explained
  below.)

  <p class="example">
    For example, if a requirement states that "authors must not use the <code>foobar</code>
    element", it would imply that documents are not allowed to contain elements named
    <code>foobar</code>.
  </p>

  <p class="note impl">
    There is no implied relationship between document conformance requirements and implementation
    conformance requirements. User agents are not free to handle non-conformant documents as they
    please; the processing model described in this specification applies to implementations
    regardless of the conformity of the input documents.
  </p>

  User agents fall into several (overlapping) categories with different conformance requirements.

  : Web browsers and other interactive user agents
  :: Web browsers that support <a href="#xhtml">the XHTML syntax</a> must process elements and attributes from the
      <a>HTML namespace</a> found in XML documents as described in this specification, so that users
      can interact with them, unless the semantics of those elements have been overridden by other
      specifications.

      <p class="example">
        A conforming XHTML processor would, upon finding an XHTML <{script}> element in an
        XML document, execute the script contained in that element. However, if the element is found
        within a transformation expressed in XSLT (assuming the user agent also supports XSLT), then
        the processor would instead treat the <{script}> element as an opaque element that
        forms part of the transform.
      </p>

      Web browsers that support <a href="#syntax">the HTML syntax</a> must process documents labeled with an
      <a>HTML MIME type</a> as described in this specification, so that users can interact with
      them.

      User agents that support scripting must also be conforming implementations of the IDL
      fragments in this specification, as described in the Web IDL specification. [[!WEBIDL]]

      <p class="note">
        Unless explicitly stated, specifications that override the semantics of HTML elements do not
        override the requirements on DOM objects representing those elements. For example, the
        <{script}> element in the example above would still implement the
        {{HTMLScriptElement}} interface.
      </p>

  : Non-interactive presentation user agents
  :: User agents that process HTML and XHTML documents purely to render non-interactive versions
      of them must comply to the same conformance criteria as Web browsers, except that they are
      exempt from requirements regarding user interaction.

      <p class="note">
        Typical examples of non-interactive presentation user agents are printers (static user agents) and
        overhead displays (dynamic user agents). It is expected that most static non-interactive
        presentation user agents will also opt to <a>lack scripting support</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="example">
        A non-interactive but dynamic presentation user agent would still execute scripts, allowing forms
        to be dynamically submitted, and so forth. However, since the concept of "focus" is
        irrelevant when the user cannot interact with the document, the user agent would not need to support
        any of the focus-related DOM APIs.
      </p>

  : <dfn for="rendering" lt="support the suggested default rendering|supporting the suggested default rendering|Visual user agents that support the suggested default rendering">Visual user agents that support the suggested default rendering</dfn>
  :: User agents, whether interactive or not, may be designated (possibly as a user option) as
      <a>supporting the suggested default rendering</a> defined by this specification.

      This is not required. In particular, even user agents that do implement the suggested default
      rendering are encouraged to offer settings that override this default to improve the
      experience for the user, e.g. changing the color contrast, using different focus styles, or
      otherwise making the experience more accessible and usable to the user.

      User agents that are designated as <a>supporting the suggested default rendering</a> must, while so
      designated, implement the rules in [[#rendering]]. That section defines
      the behavior that user agents are <em>expected</em> to implement.

  : <dfn lt="lack scripting support|User agents with no scripting support|do not support scripting">User agents with no scripting support</dfn>
  :: Implementations that do not support scripting (or which have their scripting features disabled
      entirely) are exempt from supporting the events and DOM interfaces mentioned in this
      specification. For the parts of this specification that are defined in terms of an events
      model or in terms of the DOM, such user agents must still act as if events and the DOM were
      supported.

        <p class="note">
          Scripting can form an integral part of an application. Web browsers that do not support
          scripting, or that have scripting disabled, might be unable to fully convey the author's
          intent.
        </p>

  : Conformance checkers
  :: Conformance checkers must verify that a document conforms to the applicable conformance
      criteria described in this specification. Automated conformance checkers are exempt from
      detecting errors that require interpretation of the author's intent (for example, while a
      document is non-conforming if the content of a <{blockquote}> element is not a quote,
      conformance checkers running without the input of human judgement do not have to check that
      <{blockquote}> elements only contain quoted material).

      Conformance checkers must check that the input document conforms when parsed without a
      <a>browsing context</a> (meaning that no scripts are run, and that the parser's
      <a>scripting flag</a> is disabled), and should also check that the input document conforms
      when parsed with a <a>browsing context</a> in which scripts execute, and that the scripts
      never cause non-conforming states to occur other than transiently during script execution
      itself. (This is only a "SHOULD" and not a "MUST" requirement because it has been proven to be
      impossible. [[COMPUTABLE]])

      The term "HTML validator" can be used to refer to a conformance checker that itself conforms
      to the applicable requirements of this specification.

      <div class="note">
        XML DTDs cannot express all the conformance requirements of this specification. Therefore, a
        validating XML processor and a DTD cannot constitute a conformance checker. Also, since
        neither of the two authoring formats defined in this specification are applications of SGML,
        a validating SGML system cannot constitute a conformance checker either.

        To put it another way, there are three types of conformance criteria:

        1. Criteria that can be expressed in a DTD.
        2. Criteria that cannot be expressed by a DTD, but can still be checked by a machine.
        3. Criteria that can only be checked by a human.

        A conformance checker must check for the first two. A simple DTD-based validator only checks
        for the first class of errors and is therefore not a conforming conformance checker
        according to this specification.
      </div>

  : Data mining tools
  :: Applications and tools that process HTML and XHTML documents for reasons other than to either
      render the documents or check them for conformance should act in accordance with the semantics
      of the documents that they process.

      <p class="example">
        A tool that generates <a lt="outline">document outlines</a> but increases the nesting level for each
        paragraph and does not increase the nesting level for each section would not be conforming.
      </p>

  : Authoring tools and markup generators
  :: Authoring tools and markup generators must generate <a lt="conforming document">conforming documents</a>. Conformance
      criteria that apply to authors also apply to authoring tools, where appropriate.

      Authoring tools are exempt from the strict requirements of using elements only for their
      specified purpose, but only to the extent that authoring tools are not yet able to determine
      author intent. However, authoring tools must not automatically misuse elements or encourage
      their users to do so.

      <p class="example">
        For example, it is not conforming to use an <{address}> element for arbitrary
        contact information; that element can only be used for marking up contact information for
        the author of the document or section. However, since an authoring tool is likely unable to
        determine the difference, an authoring tool is exempt from that requirement. This does not
        mean, though, that authoring tools can use <{address}> elements for any block of
        italics text (for instance); it just means that the authoring tool doesn't have to verify
        that when the user uses a tool for inserting contact information for a section, that the
        user really is doing that and not inserting something else instead.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        In terms of conformance checking, an editor has to output documents that conform to the same
        extent that a conformance checker will verify.
      </p>

      When an authoring tool is used to edit a non-conforming document, it may preserve the
      conformance errors in sections of the document that were not edited during the editing session
      (i.e. an editing tool is allowed to round-trip erroneous content). However, an authoring tool
      must not claim that the output is conformant if errors have been so preserved.

      Authoring tools are expected to come in two broad varieties: tools that work from structure
      or semantic data, and tools that work on a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get media-specific editing
      basis (WYSIWYG).

      The former is the preferred mechanism for tools that author HTML, since the structure in the
      source information can be used to make informed choices regarding which HTML elements and
      attributes are most appropriate.

      However, WYSIWYG tools are legitimate. WYSIWYG tools should use elements they know are
      appropriate, and should not use elements that they do not know to be appropriate. This might
      in certain extreme cases mean limiting the use of flow elements to just a few elements, like
      <{div}>, <{b}>, <{i}>, and <{span}> and making liberal use of the <{global/style}>
      attribute.

      All authoring tools, whether WYSIWYG or not, should make a best effort attempt at enabling
      users to create well-structured, semantically rich, media-independent content.

  <dfn lt="hardware limitations|practical concerns"></dfn>User agents may impose implementation-specific limits on otherwise unconstrained inputs, e.g. to
  prevent denial of service attacks, to guard against running out of memory, or to work around
  platform-specific limitations.
  <a class="fingerprint" href="#fingerprinting-vector"><img height="21" src="images/fingerprint.png" width="15" alt="(This is a fingerprinting vector.)" /></a>

  For compatibility with existing content and prior specifications, this specification describes
  two authoring formats: one based on XML (referred to as <a href="#xhtml">the XHTML syntax</a>), and one using a
  <a href="#writing-html-documents">custom format</a> inspired by SGML (referred to as <a href="#syntax">the HTML syntax</a>). Implementations
  must support at least one of these two formats, although supporting both is encouraged.

  Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on elements, attributes, methods or
  objects. Such requirements fall into two categories: those describing content model restrictions,
  and those describing implementation behavior. Those in the former category are requirements on
  documents and authoring tools. Those in the second category are requirements on user agents.
  Similarly, some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on authors; such requirements
  are to be interpreted as conformance requirements on the documents that authors produce. (In other
  words, this specification does not distinguish between conformance criteria on authors and
  conformance criteria on documents.)

  This specification relies on several other underlying specifications.

  : Unicode and Encoding
  :: The Unicode character set is used to represent textual data, and the Encoding standard defines
      requirements around <a>character encodings</a>. [[!UNICODE]]
      <p class="note">
        This specification <a lt="character encoding">introduces terminology</a> based on the terms defined in those
        specifications, as described earlier.
      </p>

      The following terms are used as defined in the Encoding standard: [[!ENCODING]]

      * <dfn lt="getting an encoding">Getting an encoding</dfn>
      * The <dfn>encoder</dfn> and <dfn>decoder</dfn> algorithms for various encodings, including
        the <dfn>UTF-8 encoder</dfn> and <dfn>UTF-8 decoder</dfn>
      * The generic <dfn>decode</dfn> algorithm which takes a byte stream and an encoding and
        returns a character stream
      * The <dfn>UTF-8 decode</dfn> algorithm which takes a byte stream and returns a character
        stream, additionally stripping one leading UTF-8 Byte Order Mark (BOM), if any

      <p class="note">
        The <a>UTF-8 decoder</a> is distinct from the <i>UTF-8 decode algorithm</i>. The latter
        first strips a Byte Order Mark (BOM), if any, and then invokes the former.
      </p>

      For readability, character encodings are sometimes referenced in this specification with a
      case that differs from the canonical case given in the Encoding standard. (For example,
      "UTF-16LE" instead of "utf-16le".)
  : XML and related specifications
  :: Implementations that support <a href="#xhtml">the XHTML syntax</a> must support some version of XML, as
      well as its corresponding namespaces specification, because that syntax uses an XML
      serialization with namespaces. [[!XML]] [[!XML-NAMES]]

      The attribute with the tag name <a spec="xml"><code>xml:space</code></a> in the <a>XML namespace</a>
      is defined by the XML specification. [[!XML]]

      This specification also references the <a spec="xml-stylesheet"><code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet?></code></a>
      processing instruction, defined in the
      <cite>Associating Style Sheets with XML documents</cite> specification. [[!XML-STYLESHEET]]

      This specification also non-normatively mentions the <dfn interface><code>XSLTProcessor</code></dfn>
      interface and its <dfn method for="XSLTProcessor"><code>transformToFragment()</code></dfn> and
      <dfn method for="XSLTProcessor"><code>transformToDocument()</code></dfn> methods.

      The following terms are defined in the Web IDL specification:

      * <a spec="webidl">Supported property indices</a>
      * <a spec="webidl">Determine the value of an indexed property</a>

      The term <dfn>throw</dfn> in this specification is used as defined in the WebIDL

      When this specification requires a user agent to <dfn lt="date object|a new date object">create a {{Date}} object</dfn>
      representing a particular time (which could be the special value Not-a-Number), the
      milliseconds component of that time, if any, must be truncated to an integer, and the time
      value of the newly created {{Date}} object must represent the resulting truncated
      time.

      <p class="example">
        For instance, given the time 23045 millionths of a second after 01:00 UTC on
        January 1st 2000, i.e. the time 2000-01-01T00:00:00.023045Z, then the {{Date}} object
        created representing that time would represent the same time as that created representing the
        time 2000-01-01T00:00:00.023Z, 45 millionths earlier. If the given time is NaN, then the result
        is a {{Date}} object that represents a time value NaN (indicating that the object does
        not represent a specific instant of time).
      </p>

  : JavaScript
  :: Some parts of the language described by this specification only support JavaScript as the
      underlying scripting language. [[!ECMA-262]]

      <p class="note">
        The term "JavaScript" is used to refer to ECMA262, rather than the official term ECMAScript,
        since the term JavaScript is more widely known. Similarly, the <a>MIME type</a> used to
        refer to JavaScript in this specification is <code>text/javascript</code>, since that is the
        most commonly used type, <a lt="willful violation">despite it being an officially obsoleted type</a> according to
        RFC 4329. [[RFC4329]]
      </p>

      The term <dfn lt="JavaScript global environment|JavaScript global environments">JavaScript global environment</dfn> refers to the <i>global environment</i>
      concept defined in the ECMAScript specification.

      The ECMAScript <a spec="ecma-262"><code>SyntaxError</code></a> exception is also defined in the ECMAScript
      specification. [[!ECMA-262]]

      The <a spec="ecma-262">ArrayBuffer</a> and related object types and underlying concepts from the
      ECMAScript Specification are used for several features in this specification. [[!ECMA-262]]

      The {{Date}} object type from the ECMAScript Specification is used for
      several features of this specification. [[!ECMA-262]]

      The following helper IDL is used for referring to <code>ArrayBuffer</code>-related types:

      <pre class="idl-ignore" data-highlight="webidl" dfn-for="ArrayBuffer">
        typedef (Int8Array or Uint8Array or Uint8ClampedArray or Int16Array or Uint16Array or Int32Array or Uint32Array or Float32Array or Float64Array or DataView) ArrayBufferView;
      </pre>

      <p class="note">
        In particular, the <a spec="ecma-262"><code>Uint8ClampedArray</code></a> type is used by some
        <a>2D canvas APIs</a>, and the <a interface spec="WebSockets"><code>WebSocket</code></a> API uses
        <a spec="ecma-262"><code>ArrayBuffer</code></a> objects for handling binary frames.
      </p>

  : DOM
  :: The Document Object Model (DOM) is a representation &mdash; a model &mdash; of a document and
      its content. The DOM is not just an API; the conformance criteria of HTML implementations are
      defined, in this specification, in terms of operations on the DOM. [[!DOM]]

      Implementations must support DOM and the events defined in UI Events, because this
      specification is defined in terms of the DOM, and some of the features are defined as
      extensions to the DOM interfaces. [[!DOM]] [[!UIEVENTS]]

      In particular, the following features are defined in the DOM specification: [[!DOM]]

      * {{Attr}} interface
      * {{Comment}} interface
      * {{DOMImplementation}} interface
      * {{Document}} interface
      * {{XMLDocument}} interface

      Server-Sent Events specification [[!EVENTSOURCE]]

  : Media Queries
  :: Implementations must support the Media Queries language. [[!MEDIAQ]]

  : CSS modules
  :: While support for CSS as a whole is not required of implementations of this specification
      (though it is encouraged, at least for Web browsers), some features are defined in terms of
      specific CSS requirements.

      In particular, some features require that a string be
      <dfn>parsed as a CSS &lt;color&gt; value</dfn>. When parsing a CSS value, user agents are
      required by the CSS specifications to apply some error handling rules. These apply to this
      specification also. [[!CSS3COLOR]] [[!CSS-2015]]

      <p class="example">
        For example, user agents are required to close all open constructs upon finding the end of a
        style sheet unexpectedly. Thus, when parsing the string "<code>rgb(0,0,0</code>" (with a
        missing close-parenthesis) for a color value, the close parenthesis is implied by this error
        handling rule, and a value is obtained (the color ''black''). However, the similar construct
        "<code>rgb(0,0,</code>" (with both a missing parenthesis and a missing "blue" value) cannot
        be parsed, as closing the open construct does not result in a viable value.
      </p>

      The term <dfn lt="named color|named colors">named color</dfn> is defined in the CSS Color specification. [[!CSS3COLOR]]

      The terms <dfn lt="replaced element|replaced elements">replaced element</dfn> and <dfn>intrinsic dimensions</dfn> are defined in the
      CSS specification. [[!CSS-2015]]

      The terms <dfn for="css">intrinsic width</dfn> and <dfn for="css">intrinsic height</dfn> refer to the width
      dimension and the height dimension, respectively, of <a>intrinsic dimensions</a>.

      The term <dfn>provides a paint source</dfn> is used as defined in the
      <cite>CSS Image Values and Replaced Content</cite> specification to define the interaction of
      certain HTML elements with the CSS 'element()' function. [[!CSS3-IMAGES]]

  This specification does not <em>require</em> support of any particular network protocol, style
  sheet language, scripting language, or any of the DOM specifications beyond those required in the
  list above. However, the language described by this specification is biased towards CSS as the
  styling language, JavaScript as the scripting language, and HTTP as the network protocol, and
  several features assume that those languages and protocols are in use.

  A user agent that implements the HTTP protocol must implement the Web Origin Concept
  specification and the HTTP State Management Mechanism specification (Cookies) as well. [[!HTTP]]
  [[!ORIGIN]] [[!COOKIES]]

  <p class="note">
    This specification might have certain additional requirements on character encodings, image
    formats, audio formats, and video formats in the respective sections.
  </p>
</div>

<h4 id="conformance-requirements-extensibility">Extensibility</h4>

  Vendor-specific proprietary user agent extensions to this specification are strongly discouraged.
  Documents must not use such extensions, as doing so reduces interoperability and fragments the
  user base, allowing only users of specific user agents to access the content in question.

  <div class="impl">
    If such extensions are nonetheless needed, e.g. for experimental purposes, then vendors are
    strongly urged to use one of the following extension mechanisms:

    * For markup-level features that can be limited to the XML serialization and need not be
        supported in the HTML serialization, vendors should use the namespace mechanism to define
        custom namespaces in which the non-standard elements and attributes are supported.

    * For markup-level features that are intended for use with <a href="#syntax">the HTML syntax</a>,
        extensions should be limited to new attributes of the form
        "<code>x-<var>vendor</var>-<var>feature</var></code>", where <var>vendor</var> is a short
        string that identifies the vendor responsible for the extension, and <var>feature</var> is
        the name of the feature. New element names should not be created. Using attributes for such
        extensions exclusively allows extensions from multiple vendors to co-exist on the same
        element, which would not be possible with elements. Using the
        "<code>x-<var>vendor</var>-<var>feature</var></code>" form allows extensions to be made
        without risk of conflicting with future additions to the specification.

      <div class="example">
        For instance, a browser named "FerretBrowser" could use "ferret" as a vendor prefix, while a
        browser named "Mellblom Browser" could use "mb". If both of these browsers invented
        extensions that turned elements into scratch-and-sniff areas, an author experimenting with
        these features could write:

        <pre highlight="html">
          &lt;p>This smells of lemons!
          &lt;span x-ferret-smellovision x-ferret-smellcode="LEM01"
          x-mb-outputsmell x-mb-smell="lemon juice">&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
        </pre>
      </div>

    Attribute names beginning with the two characters "<code>x-</code>" are reserved for
    user agent use and are guaranteed to never be formally added to the HTML language. For
    flexibility, attributes names containing underscores (the U+005F LOW LINE character) are also

    language.

    <p class="note">Pages that use such attributes are by definition non-conforming.</p>

    For DOM extensions, e.g. new methods and IDL attributes, the new members should be prefixed by
    vendor-specific strings to prevent clashes with future versions of this specification.

    For events, experimental event types should be prefixed with vendor-specific strings.

    <div class="example">
      For example, if a user agent called "Pleasold" were to add an event to indicate when
      the user is going up in an elevator, it could use the prefix "<code>pleasold</code>" and
      thus name the event "<code>pleasoldgoingup</code>", possibly with an event handler attribute
      named "<code>onpleasoldgoingup</code>".</p>
    </div>

    All extensions must be defined so that the use of extensions neither contradicts nor causes the
    non-conformance of functionality defined in the specification.

    <div class="example">
      For example, while strongly discouraged from doing so, an implementation "Foo Browser" could
      add a new IDL attribute "<code>fooTypeTime</code>" to a control's DOM interface that returned
      the time it took the user to select the current value of a control (say). On the other hand,
      defining a new control that appears in a form's <code>elements</code> array would be in
      violation of the above requirement, as it would violate the definition of
      <code>elements</code> given in this specification.</p>
    </div>

    When adding new <a>reflecting</a> IDL attributes corresponding to content attributes of the form
    "<code>x-<var>vendor</var>-<var>feature</var></code>", the IDL attribute should be named
    "<code><var>vendor</var><var>Feature</var></code>" (i.e. the "<code>x</code>" is dropped from
    the IDL attribute's name).</p>
</div>

<hr />

  When vendor-neutral extensions to this specification are needed, either this specification can be
  updated accordingly, or an extension specification can be written that overrides the requirements
  in this specification. When someone applying this specification to their activities decides that
  they will recognize the requirements of such an extension specification, it becomes an
  <a>applicable specification</a> for the purposes of conformance requirements in this
  specification.

  <p class="note">
    Someone could write a specification that defines any arbitrary byte stream as conforming, and
    then claim that their random junk is conforming. However, that does not mean that their random
    junk actually is conforming for everyone's purposes: if someone else decides that the
    specification does not apply to their work, then they can quite legitimately say that the
    aforementioned random junk is just that, junk, and not conforming at all. As far as conformance
    goes, what matters in a particular community is what that community <em>agrees</em> is
    applicable.

  <dfn>applicable specification</dfn>.

  The conformance terminology for documents depends on the nature of the changes introduced by such
  applicable specifications, and on the content and intended interpretation of the document.
  Applicable specifications MAY define new document content (e.g. a foobar element), MAY prohibit
  certain otherwise conforming content (e.g. prohibit use of &lt;table>s), or MAY change the
  semantics, DOM mappings, or other processing rules for content defined in this specification.
  Whether a document is or is not a <a lt="conforming document">conforming HTML5 document</a> does not depend on the use of
  applicable specifications: if the syntax and semantics of a given <a lt="conforming document">conforming HTML5 document</a>
  is unchanged by the use of applicable specification(s), then that document remains a
  <a lt="conforming document">conforming HTML5 document</a>. If the semantics or processing of a given (otherwise conforming)
  document is changed by use of applicable specification(s), then it is not a
  <a lt="conforming document">conforming HTML5 document</a>. For such cases, the applicable specifications SHOULD define
  conformance terminology.</p>

  <p class="note">
    As a suggested but not required convention, such specifications might define conformance
    terminology such as: "Conforming HTML5+XXX document", where XXX is a short name
    for the applicable specification. (Example: "Conforming HTML5+AutomotiveExtensions document").
  </p>

  <p class="note">a consequence of the rule given above is that certain syntactically correct HTML5
    documents may not be <a lt="conforming document">conforming HTML5 documents</a> in the presence of applicable
    specifications. (Example: the applicable specification defines &lt;table> to be a piece of
    furniture &#8212; a document written to that specification and containing a &lt;table> element
    is NOT a <a lt="conforming document">conforming HTML5 document</a>, even if the element happens to be syntactically
    correct HTML5.)

  User agents must treat elements and attributes that they do not understand as semantically
  neutral; leaving them in the DOM (for DOM processors), and styling them according to CSS (for CSS
  processors), but not inferring any meaning from them.

  When support for a feature is disabled (e.g. as an emergency measure to mitigate a security
  problem, or to aid in development, or for performance reasons), user agents must act as if they
  had no support for the feature whatsoever, and as if the feature was not mentioned in this
  specification. For example, if a particular feature is accessed via an attribute in a Web IDL
  interface, the attribute itself would be omitted from the objects that implement that interface
  &mdash; leaving the attribute on the object but making it return null or throw an exception is
  insufficient.

  <h4 id="interactions-with-xpath-and-xslt">Interactions with XPath and XSLT</h4>

  Implementations of XPath 1.0 that operate on <a>HTML documents</a> parsed or created in the
  manners described in this specification (e.g. as part of the <code>document.evaluate()</code> API)
  must act as if the following edit was applied to the XPath 1.0 specification.

  First, remove this paragraph:

  <blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116#node-tests">
    A <a>QName</a> in the node test is expanded into an <a>expanded-name</a> using the namespace
    declarations from the expression context. This is the same way expansion is done for element
    type names in start and end-tags except that the default namespace declared with
    <code>xmlns</code> is not used: if the <a>QName</a> does not have a prefix, then the namespace
    URI is null (this is the same way attribute names are expanded). It is an error if the
    <a>QName</a> has a prefix for which there is no namespace declaration in the expression context.
  </blockquote>

  Then, insert in its place the following:

  <blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=7059#c37">
    A QName in the node test is expanded into an expanded-name using the namespace declarations from
    the expression context. If the QName has a prefix, then there must be a namespace declaration
    for this prefix in the expression context, and the corresponding namespace URI is the one that
    is associated with this prefix. It is an error if the QName has a prefix for which there is no
    namespace declaration in the expression context.

    If the QName has no prefix and the principal node type of the axis is element, then the default
    element namespace is used. Otherwise if the QName has no prefix, the namespace URI is null. The
    default element namespace is a member of the context for the XPath expression. The value of the
    default element namespace when executing an XPath expression through the DOM3 XPath API is
    determined in the following way:

    1. If the context node is from an HTML DOM, the default element namespace is
        "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml".
    2. Otherwise, the default element namespace URI is null.

    <p class="note">
      This is equivalent to adding the default element namespace feature of XPath 2.0 to XPath 1.0,
      and using the HTML namespace as the default element namespace for HTML documents. It is
      motivated by the desire to have implementations be compatible with legacy HTML content while
      still supporting the changes that this specification introduces to HTML regarding the
      namespace used for HTML elements, and by the desire to use XPath 1.0 rather than XPath 2.0.

  XSLT 1.0 processors outputting to a DOM when the output method is "html" (either explicitly or via
  the defaulting rule in XSLT 1.0) are affected as follows:

  the names of any non-namespaced attributes on the element.

  <p class="note">
    This requirement is a <a>willful violation</a> of the XSLT 1.0 specification, required because
    this specification changes the namespaces and case-sensitivity rules of HTML in a manner that
    would otherwise be incompatible with DOM-based XSLT transformations. (Processors that serialize
    the output are unaffected.) [[XSLT]]

  This specification does not specify precisely how XSLT processing interacts with the

  Some of the micro-parsers described below follow the pattern of having an <var>input</var>

  For parsers based on this pattern, a step that requires the user agent to <dfn>collect a sequence
  of characters</dfn> means that the following algorithm must be run, with <var>characters</var>
  being the set of characters that can be collected:

  1. Let <var>input</var> and <var>position</var> be the same variables as those of the same name in

  4. Return <var>result</var>.

  The step <dfn>skip whitespace</dfn> means that the user agent must

  When a user agent is to <dfn lt="stripped line breaks|strip line breaks">strip line breaks</dfn> from a string, the user agent must remove

  When a user agent has to <dfn lt="strictly splitting the string|strictly split a string|strictly split">strictly split a string</dfn> on a particular delimiter character

  Some attributes are defined as taking one of a finite set of keywords. Such attributes are called

  If an enumerated attribute is specified, the attribute's value must be an

  non-conforming, with no leading or trailing whitespace.

  When the attribute is specified, if its value is an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for one of
  the given keywords then that keyword's state is the state that the attribute represents. If the
  attribute value matches none of the given keywords, but the attribute has an
  <i>invalid value default</i>, then the attribute represents that state. Otherwise, if the
  attribute value matches none of the keywords but there is a <i>missing value default</i> state
  defined, then <em>that</em> is the state represented by the attribute. Otherwise, there is no
  default, and invalid values mean that there is no state represented.

  When the attribute is <em>not</em> specified, if there is a <i>missing value default</i> state
  defined, then that is the state represented by the (missing) attribute. Otherwise, the absence of
  the attribute means that there is no state represented.

    must always return the same string for that value (though it may differ from the value used by
    other user agents).

    The <dfn>rules for parsing floating-point number values</dfn> are as given in the following
    algorithm. This algorithm must be aborted at the first step that returns something. This
    algorithm will return either a number or an error.

    1. Let <var>input</var> be the string being parsed.
    2. Let <var>position</var> be a pointer into <var>input</var>, initially pointing at the start
        of the string.
    3. Let <var>value</var> have the value 1.
    4. Let <var>divisor</var> have the value 1.
    5. Let <var>exponent</var> have the value 1.
    6. <a>Skip whitespace</a>.
    7. If <var>position</var> is past the end of <var>input</var>, return an error.
    8. If the character indicated by <var>position</var> is a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS character (-):
        1. Change <var>value</var> and <var>divisor</var> to -1.
        2. Advance <var>position</var> to the next character.
        3. If <var>position</var> is past the end of <var>input</var>, return an error.

        Otherwise, if the character indicated by <var>position</var> (the first character) is a
        U+002B PLUS SIGN character (+):

        1. Advance <var>position</var> to the next character. (The "<code>+</code>" is ignored, but
            it is not conforming.)
        2. If <var>position</var> is past the end of <var>input</var>, return an error.

    9. If the character indicated by <var>position</var> is a U+002E FULL STOP (.), and that is not
        the last character in <var>input</var>, and the character after the character indicated by
        <var>position</var> is an <a>ASCII digit</a>, then set
        <var>value</var> to zero and jump to the step labeled <i>fraction</i>.
    10. If the character indicated by <var>position</var> is not an <a>ASCII digit</a>, then return
        an error.
    11. <a>Collect a sequence of characters</a> that are <a>ASCII digits</a>, and interpret the
        resulting sequence as a base-ten integer. Multiply <var>value</var> by that integer.
    12. If <var>position</var> is past the end of <var>input</var>, jump to the step labeled
        <i>conversion</i>.
    13. <i>Fraction</i>: If the character indicated by <var>position</var> is a U+002E FULL STOP
        (.), run these substeps:
        1. Advance <var>position</var> to the next character.
        2. If <var>position</var> is past the end of <var>input</var>, or if the character indicated
            by <var>position</var> is not an <a>ASCII digit</a>, U+0065 LATIN SMALL LETTER E (e), or
            U+0045 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E (E), then jump to the step labeled <i>conversion</i>.
        3. If the character indicated by <var>position</var> is a U+0065 LATIN SMALL LETTER E
            character (e) or a U+0045 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E character (E), skip the remainder of
            these substeps.
        4. <i>Fraction loop</i>: Multiply <var>divisor</var> by ten.
        5. Add the value of the character indicated by <var>position</var>, interpreted as a
            base-ten digit (0..9) and divided by <var>divisor</var>, to <var>value</var>.
        6. Advance <var>position</var> to the next character.
        7. If <var>position</var> is past the end of <var>input</var>, then jump to the step labeled
            <i>conversion</i>.
        8. If the character indicated by <var>position</var> is an <a>ASCII digit</a>, jump back to
            the step labeled <i>fraction loop</i> in these substeps.
    14. If the character indicated by <var>position</var> is a U+0065 LATIN SMALL LETTER E character
        (e) or a U+0045 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E character (E), run these substeps:
        1. Advance <var>position</var> to the next character.
        2. If <var>position</var> is past the end of <var>input</var>, then jump to the step labeled
            <i>conversion</i>.
        3. If the character indicated by <var>position</var> is a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS character (-):
            1. Change <var>exponent</var> to -1.
            2. Advance <var>position</var> to the next character.
            3. If <var>position</var> is past the end of <var>input</var>, then jump to the step
                labeled <i>conversion</i>.

        Otherwise, if the character indicated by <var>position</var> is a U+002B PLUS SIGN character
        (+):

            1. Advance <var>position</var> to the next character.
            2. If <var>position</var> is past the end of <var>input</var>, then jump to the step
                labeled <i>conversion</i>.
        4. If the character indicated by <var>position</var> is not an <a>ASCII digit</a>, then jump
            to the step labeled <i>conversion</i>.
        5. <a>Collect a sequence of characters</a> that are <a>ASCII digits</a>, and interpret the
            resulting sequence as a base-ten integer. Multiply <var>exponent</var> by that integer.
        6. Multiply <var>value</var> by ten raised to the <var>exponent</var>th power.
    15. <i>Conversion</i>: Let <var>S</var> be the set of finite IEEE 754 double-precision
        floating-point values except -0, but with two special values added: 2<sup>1024</sup>
        and -2<sup>1024</sup>.
    16. Let <var>rounded-value</var> be the number in <var>S</var> that is closest to
        <var>value</var>, selecting the number with an even significand if there are two equally
        close values. (The two special values 2<sup>1024</sup> and -2<sup>1024</sup> are
        considered to have even significands for this purpose.)
    17. If <var>rounded-value</var> is 2<sup>1024</sup> or -2<sup>1024</sup>, return an
        error.
    18. Return <var>rounded-value</var>.

  and a fraction of a second, expressed with a time-zone offset, consisting of a signed number of
  hours and minutes. [[GREGORIAN]]

  A string is a <dfn>valid global date and time string</dfn> representing a date, time, and a
  time-zone offset if it consists of the following components in the given order:

  1. A <a>valid date string</a> representing the date
  2. A U+0054 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T character (T) or a U+0020 SPACE character
  3. A <a>valid time string</a> representing the time
  4. A <a>valid time-zone offset string</a> representing the time-zone offset

  Times in dates before the formation of UTC in the mid twentieth century must be expressed and
  interpreted in terms of UT1 (contemporary Earth solar time at the 0&deg; longitude), not UTC (the
  approximation of UT1 that ticks in SI seconds). Time before the formation of time zones must be
  expressed and interpreted as UT1 times with explicit time zones that approximate the contemporary
  difference between the appropriate local time and the time observed at the location of Greenwich,
  London.

  <div class="example">
    The following are some examples of dates written as <a>valid global date and time strings</a>.

    : "<code>0037-12-13 00:00Z</code>"
    :: Midnight in areas using London time on the birthday of Nero (the Roman Emperor). See below
        for further discussion on which date this actually corresponds to.

    : "<code>1979-10-14T12:00:00.001-04:00</code>"
    :: One millisecond after noon on October 14th 1979, in the time zone in use on the east coast of
        the USA during daylight saving time.

    : "<code>8592-01-01T02:09+02:09</code>"
    :: Midnight UTC on the 1st of January, 8592. The time zone associated with that time is two
        hours and nine minutes ahead of UTC, which is not currently a real time zone, but is
        nonetheless allowed.

    Several things are notable about these dates:

    * Years with fewer than four digits have to be zero-padded. The date "37-12-13" would not be a
        valid date.
    * If the "<code>T</code>" is replaced by a space, it must be a single space character. The
        string "<code>2001-12-21&nbsp;&nbsp;12:00Z</code>" (with two spaces between the components)
        would not be parsed successfully.
    * To unambiguously identify a moment in time prior to the introduction of the Gregorian calendar
        (insofar as moments in time before the formation of UTC can be unambiguously identified),
        the date has to be first converted to the Gregorian calendar from the calendar in use at the
        time (e.g. from the Julian calendar). The date of Nero's birth is the 15th of December 37,
        in the Julian Calendar, which is the 13th of December 37 in the
        <a>proleptic Gregorian calendar</a>.
    * The time and time-zone offset components are not optional.
    * Dates before the year one can't be represented as a datetime in this version of HTML.
    * Times of specific events in ancient times are, at best, approximations, since time was not
        well coordinated or measured until relatively recent decades.
    * Time-zone offsets differ based on daylight savings time.

  <p class="note">
    The zone offset is not a complete time zone specification. When working with real date and time
    values, consider using a separate field for time zone, perhaps using IANA time zone IDs.

  2. A U+0054 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T character (T)
  3. A <a>valid time string</a> representing the time converted to the UTC time zone and expressed

<h5 id="weeks">Weeks</h5>

  A <dfn>week</dfn> consists of a week-year number and a week number representing a seven-day period
  starting on a Monday. Each week-year in this calendaring system has either 52 or 53 such seven-day
  periods, as defined below. The seven-day period starting on the Gregorian date Monday December
  29th 1969 (1969-12-29) is defined as week number 1 in week-year 1970. Consecutive weeks are
  numbered sequentially. The week before the number 1 week in a week-year is the last week in the
  previous week-year, and vice versa. [[GREGORIAN]]

  A week-year with a number <var>year</var> has 53 weeks if it corresponds to either a year
  <var>year</var> in the <a>proleptic Gregorian calendar</a> that has a Thursday as its first
  day (January 1st), or a year <var>year</var> in the <a>proleptic Gregorian calendar</a> that has
  a Wednesday as its first day (January 1st) and where <var>year</var> is a number divisible by 400,
  or a number divisible by 4 but not by 100. All other week-years have 52 weeks.

  The <dfn>week number of the last day</dfn> of a week-year with 53 weeks is 53; the week number of
  the last day of a week-year with 52 weeks is 52.

  <p class="note">
    The week-year number of a particular day can be different than the number of the year that
    contains that day in the <a>proleptic Gregorian calendar</a>. The first week in a week-year
    <var>y</var> is the week that contains the first Thursday of the Gregorian year <var>y</var>.

  <p class="note">
    For modern purposes, a <a>week</a> as defined here is equivalent to ISO weeks as defined in ISO
    8601. [[ISO8601]]

<h5 id="durations">Durations</h5>

  A <dfn>duration</dfn> consists of a number of seconds.

  <p class="note">
    Since months and seconds are not comparable (a month is not a precise number of seconds, but is
    instead a period whose exact length depends on the precise day from which it is measured) a
    <a>duration</a> as defined in this specification cannot include months (or years, which are
    equivalent to twelve months). Only durations that describe a specific number of seconds can be
    described.
  </p>

  A string is a <dfn>valid duration string</dfn> representing a <a>duration</a> <var>t</var> if it
  consists of either of the following:

  * A literal U+0050 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER P character followed by one or more of the following
    subcomponents, in the order given, where the number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds
    corresponds to the same number of seconds as in <var>t</var>:

    1. One or more <a>ASCII digits</a> followed by a U+0044 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D character,
        representing a number of days.
    2. A U+0054 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T character followed by one or more of the following
        subcomponents, in the order given:
        1. One or more <a>ASCII digits</a> followed by a U+0048 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER H
            character, representing a number of hours.
        2. One or more <a>ASCII digits</a> followed by a U+004D LATIN CAPITAL LETTER M
            character, representing a number of minutes.
        3. The following components:
            1. One or more <a>ASCII digits</a>, representing a number of seconds.
            2. Optionally, a U+002E FULL STOP character (.) followed by one, two, or three

  A <dfn>simple color</dfn> consists of three 8-bit numbers in the range 0..255, representing the
  red, green, and blue components of the color respectively, in the sRGB color space. [[!SRGB]]

  A string is a <dfn>valid simple color</dfn> if it is exactly seven characters long, and the first
  character is a U+0023 NUMBER SIGN character (#), and the remaining six characters are all
  <a>ASCII hex digits</a>, with the first two digits representing the red component, the middle two

    <h3 id="fetching-resources">Fetching resources</h3>

    <h4 id="fetching-resources-terminology">Terminology</h4>

    User agents can implement a variety of transfer protocols, but this specification mostly defines
    behavior in terms of HTTP. [[!HTTP]]

    The <dfn lt="or equivalent|HTTP GET method">HTTP GET method</dfn> is equivalent to the default retrieval action of the protocol.
    For example, RETR in FTP. Such actions are idempotent and safe, in HTTP terms.

    The <dfn>HTTP response codes</dfn> are equivalent to statuses in other protocols that have the
    same basic meanings. For example, a "file not found" error is equivalent to a 404 code, a server
    error is equivalent to a 5xx code, and so on.

    The <dfn>HTTP headers</dfn> are equivalent to fields in
    other protocols that have the same basic meaning. For example, the HTTP authentication headers
    are equivalent to the authentication aspects of the FTP protocol.

    A <dfn>referrer source</dfn> is either a {{Document}} or a <a for="url">URL</a>.

    To <dfn lt="creating a potential-cors request|create a potential-CORS request">create a potential-CORS request</dfn>, given a <var>url</var>,
    <var>corsAttributeState</var>, and an optional <i>same-origin fallback flag</i>, run these steps:

    1. Let <var>mode</var> be "<code>no-cors</code>" if <var>corsAttributeState</var> is
        <a>No CORS</a>, and "<code>cors</code>" otherwise.

    2. If <i>same-origin fallback flag</i> is set and <var>mode</var> is "<code>no-cors</code>", set
        <var>mode</var> to "<code>same-origin</code>".

    3. Let <var>credentialsMode</var> be "<code>include</code>".

    4. If <var>corsAttributeState</var> is <a>Anonymous</a>, set <var>credentialsMode</var> to
        "<code>same-origin</code>".

    5. Let <var>request</var> be a new <a>request</a> whose <a for="url">URL</a> is <var>url</var>,
        <a>destination</a> is "<code>subresource</code>", <a>mode</a> is <var>mode</var>,
        <a>credentials mode</a> is <var>credentialsMode</var>, and whose
        <a>use-URL-credentials flag</a> is set.

    <h4 id="fetching-resources-processing-model">Processing model</h4>

    When a user agent is to <a spec="fetch">fetch</a> a resource or <a spec="url" for="url">URL</a>, optionally
    <strong>from</strong> an origin <i>origin</i>, optionally <strong>using</strong> a specific
    <a>referrer source</a> as an <i>override referrer source</i>, and optionally with any of a
    <i>synchronous flag</i>, a <i>manual redirect flag</i>, a <i>force same-origin flag</i>, and a
    <i>block cookies flag</i>, the following steps must be run. (When a <em>URL</em> is to be
    fetched, the URL identifies a resource to be obtained.)

    1. If there is a specific <i>override referrer source</i>, and it is a <a for="url">URL</a>, then let
        <var>referrer</var> be the <i>override referrer source</i>, and jump to the step labeled
        <i>clean referrer</i>.

    2. Let <var>document</var> be the appropriate {{Document}} as given by the following
        list:
        <dl class="switch">
          <dt>If there is a specific <i>override referrer source</i></dt>
          <dd>The <i>override referrer source</i>.</dd>

          <dt>When <a>navigating</a></dt>
          <dd>The <a>active document</a> of the <a>source browsing context</a>.</dd>

          <dt>When fetching resources for an element</dt>
          <dd>The element's {{Document}}.</dd>
        </dl>
    3. While <var>document</var> is <a lt="iframe srcdoc document">an <code>iframe</code> <code>srcdoc</code> document</a>, let
        <var>document</var> be <var>document</var>'s <a>browsing context</a>'s
        <a>browsing context container</a>'s {{Document}} instead.
    4. If the <a spec="fetch">origin</a> of <var>Document</var> is not a scheme/host/port tuple, then set
        <var>referrer</var> to the empty string and jump to the step labeled <i>clean referrer</i>.
    5. Let <var>referrer</var> be <a>the document's address</a> of <var>document</var>.
    6. <i>Clean referrer</i>: Apply the <a>URL parser</a> to <var>referrer</var> and let
        <var>parsed referrer</var> be the <a>resulting parsed URL</a>.
    7. Let <var>referrer</var> be the result of applying the <a spec="url">URL serializer</a> to
        <var>parsed referrer</var>, with the <i>exclude fragment flag</i> set.
    8. If <var>referrer</var> is not the empty string, is not a <a scheme lt="data:"><code>data:</code> URL</a>, and
        is not the <a for="url">URL</a> "<code>about:blank</code>", then generate the <i>address of the
        resource from which Request-URIs are obtained</i> as required by HTTP for the
        <code>Referer</code> (sic) header from <var>referrer</var>. [[!HTTP]]

        Otherwise, the <code>Referer</code> (sic) header must be omitted, regardless of its value.
    9. If the algorithm was not invoked with the <i>synchronous flag</i>, perform the remaining
        steps <a>in parallel</a>.
    10. If the {{Document}} with which any <a>tasks</a> <a>queued</a> by this algorithm
        would be associated doesn't have an associated <a>browsing context</a>, then abort these
        steps.
    11. This is the <i>main step</i>.

        If the resource is to be obtained from an <a>application cache</a>, then use the data from
        that <a>application cache</a>, as if it had been obtained in the manner appropriate given
        its <a for="url">URL</a>.

        If the resource is identified by an <a>absolute URL</a>, and the resource is to be obtained
        using an idempotent action (such as an HTTP GET <a>or equivalent</a>), and it is already
        being downloaded for other reasons (e.g. another invocation of this algorithm), and this
        request would be identical to the previous one (e.g. same <code>Accept</code> and
        <code>Origin</code> headers), and the user agent is configured such that it is to reuse the
        data from the existing download instead of initiating a new one, then use the results of the
        existing download instead of starting a new one.

        Otherwise, if the resource is identified by an <a>absolute URL</a> with a scheme that does
        not define a mechanism to obtain the resource (e.g. it is a <code>mailto:</code> URL) or
        that the user agent does not support, then act as if the resource was an HTTP 204 No Content
        response with no other metadata.

        Otherwise, if the resource is identified by the <a for="url">URL</a>
        <code>about:blank</code>, then the resource is immediately available and consists
        of the empty string, with no metadata.

        Otherwise, at a time convenient to the user and the user agent, download (or otherwise
        obtain) the resource, applying the semantics of the relevant specifications (e.g. performing
        an HTTP GET or POST operation, or reading the file from disk, or expanding
        <a scheme lt="data:"><code>data:</code> URLs</a>, etc).

        For the purposes of the <code>Referer</code> (sic) header, use the
        <i>address of the resource from which Request-URIs are obtained</i> generated in the earlier
        step.

        For the purposes of the <code>Origin</code> header, if the <a spec="fetch">fetching algorithm</a> was
        explicitly initiated from an <i>origin</i>, then
        <i>the origin that initiated the HTTP request</i> is <i>origin</i>. Otherwise, this is
        <i>a request from a "privacy-sensitive" context</i>. [[!ORIGIN]]
    12. If the algorithm was not invoked with the <i>block cookies flag</i>, and there are cookies
        to be set, update the cookies. [[!COOKIES]]
            <a class="fingerprint" href="#fingerprinting-vector"><img height="21" src="images/fingerprint.png" width="15" alt="(This is a fingerprinting vector.)" /></a>
    13. If the fetched resource is an HTTP redirect <a>or equivalent</a>, then:

        <dl class="switch">
          <dt>
            If the <i>force same-origin flag</i> is set and the <a for="url">URL</a> of the target of the
            redirect does not have the <a>same origin</a> as the <a for="url">URL</a> for which the
            <a>fetch</a> algorithm was invoked
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Abort these steps and return failure from this algorithm, as if the remote host could
            not be contacted.
          </dd>

          <dt>If the <i>manual redirect flag</i> is set</dt>
          <dd>
            Continue, using the fetched resource (the redirect) as the result of the algorithm. If
            the calling algorithm subsequently requires the user agent to
            <dfn>transparently follow the redirect</dfn>, then the user agent must resume this
            algorithm from the <i>main step</i>, but using the target of the redirect as the
            resource to fetch, rather than the original resource.
          </dd>

          <dt>Otherwise</dt>
          <dd>
            First, apply any relevant requirements for redirects (such as showing any appropriate
            prompts). Then, redo <i>main step</i>, but using the target of the redirect as the
            resource to fetch, rather than the original resource. For HTTP requests, the new request
            must include the same headers as the original request, except for headers for which
            other requirements are specified (such as the <code>Host</code> header). [[!HTTP]]

            <p class="note">
              The HTTP specification requires that 301, 302, and 307 redirects, when applied to
              methods other than the safe methods, not be followed without user confirmation. That
              would be an appropriate prompt for the purposes of the requirement in the paragraph
              above. [[!HTTP]]
          </dd>
        </dl>
    14. If the algorithm was not invoked with the <i>synchronous flag</i>: When the resource is
        available, or if there is an error of some description, <a>queue a task</a> that uses the
        resource as appropriate. If the resource can be processed incrementally, as, for instance,
        with a progressively interlaced JPEG or an HTML file, additional tasks may be queued to
        process the data as it is downloaded. The <a>task source</a> for these <a>tasks</a> is the
        <a>networking task source</a>.

        Otherwise, return the resource or error information to the calling algorithm.

    If the user agent can determine the actual length of the resource being <a>fetched</a> for an
    instance of this algorithm, and if that length is finite, then that length is the file's
    <dfn>size</dfn>. Otherwise, the subject of the algorithm (that is, the resource being fetched)
    has no known <a>size</a>. (For example, the HTTP <code>Content-Length</code> header might
    provide this information.)

    The user agent must also keep track of the <dfn>number of bytes downloaded</dfn> for each
    instance of this algorithm. This number must exclude any out-of-band metadata, such as HTTP
    headers.

    <p class="note">
      The <a>application cache</a> processing model introduces some
      <a href="#changes-to-the-networking-model">changes to the networking model</a> to handle the returning of cached resources.

    <p class="note">
      The <a>navigation</a> processing model handles redirects itself, overriding the redirection
      handling that would be done by the <a spec="fetch">fetching algorithm</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      Whether the <a href="#content-type-sniffing">type sniffing rules</a> apply to the fetched resource depends on the algorithm
      that invokes the rules &mdash; they are not always applicable.

    <h4 id="encrypted-http-and-related-security-concerns">Encrypted HTTP and related security concerns</h4>

    Anything in this specification that refers to HTTP also applies to HTTP-over-TLS, as represented
    by [[url#urls|URLs]] representing the <code>https</code> scheme. [[!HTTP]]

    <p class="warning">
      User agents should report certificate errors to the user and must either refuse to download
      resources sent with erroneous certificates or must act as if such resources were in fact
      served with no encryption.
    </p>

    User agents should warn the user that there is a potential problem whenever the user visits a
    page that the user has previously visited, if the page uses less secure encryption on the second
    visit.

    Not doing so can result in users not noticing man-in-the-middle attacks.

    <div class="example">
      If a user connects to a server with a self-signed certificate, the user agent could allow the
      connection but just act as if there had been no encryption. If the user agent instead allowed
      the user to override the problem and then displayed the page as if it was fully and safely
      encrypted, the user could be easily tricked into accepting man-in-the-middle connections.

      If a user connects to a server with full encryption, but the page then refers to an external
      resource that has an expired certificate, then the user agent will act as if the resource was
      unavailable, possibly also reporting the problem to the user. If the user agent instead
      allowed the resource to be used, then an attacker could just look for "secure" sites that used
      resources from a different host and only apply man-in-the-middle attacks to that host, for
      example taking over scripts in the page.

      If a user bookmarks a site that uses a CA-signed certificate, and then later revisits that
      site directly but the site has started using a self-signed certificate, the user agent could
      warn the user that a man-in-the-middle attack is likely underway, instead of simply acting as
      if the page was not encrypted.

    1. Let <var>position</var> be a pointer into <var>s</var>, initially pointing at the start of
        the string.
    2. <i>Loop</i>: Find the first seven characters in <var>s</var> after <var>position</var> that

    5. Skip any <a>space characters</a> that immediately follow the equals sign (there might not be

  The empty string is also a valid keyword, and maps to the <a state for="cors">Anonymous</a> state. The attribute's

<h4 id="reflecting-content-attributes-in-idl-attributes">Reflecting content attributes in IDL attributes</h4>

  Some IDL attributes are defined to <dfn lt="reflection|reflect">reflect</dfn> a particular content attribute. This means
  that on getting, the IDL attribute returns the current value of the content attribute, and on
  setting, the IDL attribute changes the value of the content attribute to the given value.

  <div class="impl">
    In general, on getting, if the content attribute is not present, the IDL attribute must act as
    if the content attribute's value is the empty string; and on setting, if the content attribute
    is not present, it must first be added.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute is a <code>DOMString</code> attribute whose content attribute is
    defined to contain a <a for="url">URL</a>, then on getting, the IDL attribute must <a>resolve</a> the
    value of the content attribute relative to the element and return the resulting

    set the content attribute to the specified literal value. If the content attribute is absent,
    the IDL attribute must return the default value, if the content attribute has one, or else the
    empty string.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute is a <code>DOMString</code> attribute whose content attribute is
    defined to contain one or more [[url#urls|URLs]], then on getting, the IDL attribute must <a lt="split a string on spaces">split the

    absent, the IDL attribute must return the default value, if the content attribute has one, or
    else the empty string. On setting, the IDL attribute must set the content attribute to the
    specified literal value.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute is a <code>DOMString</code> attribute whose content attribute is
    an <a>enumerated attribute</a>, and the IDL attribute is <dfn>limited to only known values</dfn>,
    then, on getting, the IDL attribute must return the conforming value associated with the state
    the attribute is in (in its canonical case), if any, or the empty string if the attribute is in
    a state that has no associated keyword value or if the attribute is not in a defined state (e.g.
    the attribute is missing and there is no <i>missing value default</i>); and on setting, the
    content attribute must be set to the specified new value.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute is a nullable <code>DOMString</code> attribute whose content
    attribute is an <a>enumerated attribute</a>, then, on getting, if the corresponding content
    attribute is in its <i>missing value default</i> then the IDL attribute must return null,
    otherwise, the IDL attribute must return the conforming value associated with the state the

    of the above categories, then the getting and setting must be done in a transparent,
    case-preserving manner.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute is a <code>boolean</code> attribute, then on getting the IDL
    attribute must return true if the content attribute is set, and false if it is absent. On
    setting, the content attribute must be removed if the IDL attribute is set to false, and must be
    set to the empty string if the IDL attribute is set to true. (This corresponds to the rules for
    <a lt="boolean attributes">boolean content attributes</a>.)

    If a reflecting IDL attribute has a signed integer type (<code>long</code>) then, on getting,
    the content attribute must be parsed according to the <a>rules for parsing signed integers</a>,
    and if that is successful, and the value is in the range of the IDL attribute's type, the
    resulting value must be returned. If, on the other hand, it fails or returns an out of range
    value, or if the attribute is absent, then the default value must be returned instead, or 0 if
    there is no default value. On setting, the given value must be converted to the shortest
    possible string representing the number as a <a>valid integer</a> and then that string must be
    used as the new content attribute value.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute has a signed integer type (<code>long</code>)
    that is <dfn>limited to only non-negative numbers</dfn> then, on getting, the content attribute
    must be parsed according to the <a>rules for parsing non-negative integers</a>, and if that
    is successful, and the value is in the range of the IDL attribute's type, the resulting value
    must be returned. If, on the other hand, it fails or returns an out of range value, or if the
    attribute is absent, the default value must be returned instead, or -1 if there is no
    default value. On setting, if the value is negative, the user agent must throw an
    <code>IndexSizeError</code> exception. Otherwise, the given value must be converted to the
    shortest possible string representing the number as a <a>valid non-negative integer</a> and then
    that string must be used as the new content attribute value.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute has an <em>unsigned</em> integer type (<code>unsigned long</code>)
    then, on getting, the content attribute must be parsed according to the <a>rules for parsing
    non-negative integers</a>, and if that is successful, and the value is in the range 0 to
    2147483647 inclusive, the resulting value must be returned. If, on the other hand, it fails or
    returns an out of range value, or if the attribute is absent, the default value must be returned
    instead, or 0 if there is no default value. On setting, first, if the new value is in the range
    0 to 2147483647, then let <var>n</var> be the new value, otherwise let <var>n</var> be the
    default value, or 0 if there is no default value; then, <var>n</var> must be converted to the
    shortest possible string representing the number as a <a>valid non-negative integer</a> and that
    string must be used as the new content attribute value.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute has an unsigned integer type (<code>unsigned long</code>) that is
    <dfn>limited to only non-negative numbers greater than zero</dfn>, then the behavior is similar
    to the previous case, but zero is not allowed. On getting, the content attribute must first be
    parsed according to the <a>rules for parsing non-negative integers</a>, and if that is
    successful, and the value is in the range 1 to 2147483647 inclusive, the resulting value must be
    returned. If, on the other hand, it fails or returns an out of range value, or if the attribute
    is absent, the default value must be returned instead, or 1 if there is no default value. On
    setting, if the value is zero, the user agent must throw an <code>IndexSizeError</code>
    exception. Otherwise, first, if the new value is in the range 1 to 2147483647, then let
    <var>n</var> be the new value, otherwise let <var>n</var> be the default value, or 1 if there is
    no default value; then, <var>n</var> must be converted to the shortest possible string
    representing the number as a <a>valid non-negative integer</a> and that string must be used as
    the new content attribute value.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute has a floating-point number type (<code>double</code> or
    <code>unrestricted double</code>), then, on getting, the content attribute must be parsed
    according to the <a>rules for parsing floating-point number values</a>, and if that is
    successful, the resulting value must be returned. If, on the other hand, it fails, or if the
    attribute is absent, the default value must be returned instead, or 0.0 if there is no default
    value. On setting, the given value must be converted to the <a lt="floating point number">best representation of the number
    as a floating-point number</a> and then that string must be used as the new content attribute
    value.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute has a floating-point number type (<code>double</code> or
    <code>unrestricted double</code>) that is <dfn>limited to numbers greater than zero</dfn>, then
    the behavior is similar to the previous case, but zero and negative values are not allowed. On
    getting, the content attribute must be parsed according to the <a>rules for parsing
    floating-point number values</a>, and if that is successful and the value is greater than 0.0,
    the resulting value must be returned. If, on the other hand, it fails or returns an out of range
    value, or if the attribute is absent, the default value must be returned instead, or 0.0 if
    there is no default value. On setting, if the value is less than or equal to zero, then the
    value must be ignored. Otherwise, the given value must be converted to the
    <a lt="floating point number">best representation of the number as a floating-point number</a> and then that string must be
    used as the new content attribute value.

    <p class="note">
      The values Infinity and Not-a-Number (NaN) values throw an exception on setting, as defined in
      the Web IDL specification. [[!WEBIDL]]
    </p>

    If a reflecting IDL attribute has the type {{DOMTokenList}}, then on getting it must return a
    {{DOMTokenList}} object whose associated element is the element in question and whose associated
    attribute's local name is the name of the attribute in question. The same {{DOMTokenList}}
    object must be returned every time for each attribute.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute has the type {{HTMLElement}}, or an interface that
    descends from {{HTMLElement}}, then, on getting, it must run the following algorithm
    (stopping at the first point where a value is returned):

    1. If the corresponding content attribute is absent, then the IDL attribute must return null.
    2. Let <var>candidate</var> be the element that the <code>document.getElementById()</code>
        method would find when called on the content attribute's element's <a>node document</a> if
        it were passed as its argument the current value of the corresponding content attribute.
    3. If <var>candidate</var> is null, or if it is not type-compatible with the IDL attribute, then
        the IDL attribute must return null.
    4. Otherwise, it must return <var>candidate</var>.

    On setting, if the given element has an <code>id</code> attribute, and has the same
    <a>home subtree</a> as the element of the attribute being set, and the given element is the
    first element in that <a>home subtree</a> whose <a>ID</a> is the value of that <code>id</code>
    attribute, then the content attribute must be set to the value of that <code>id</code>
    attribute. Otherwise, the content attribute must be set to the empty string.

  5. If <var>n</var> is greater than or equal to zero, <a>append</a> <var>value</var> to the

  The <dfn method for="HTMLOptionsCollection"><code>add(<var>element</var>, <var>before</var>)</code></dfn> method must act according

      exception and abort these steps.
  2. If <var>before</var> is an element, but that element isn't a descendant of the
      <{select}> element on which the <code>HTMLOptionsCollection</code> is rooted, then
      throw a <code>NotFoundError</code> exception and abort these steps.
  3. If <var>element</var> and <var>before</var> are the same element, then return and abort these
      steps.
  4. If <var>before</var> is a node, then let <var>reference</var> be that node. Otherwise, if
      <var>before</var> is an integer, and there is a <var>before</var>th node in the collection,
      let <var>reference</var> be that node. Otherwise, let <var>reference</var> be null.
  5. If <var>reference</var> is not null, let <var>parent</var> be the parent node of
      <var>reference</var>. Otherwise, let <var>parent</var> be the <{select}> element on
      which the <code>HTMLOptionsCollection</code> is rooted.
  6. Act as if the DOM <code>insertBefore()</code> method was invoked on the <var>parent</var> node,
      with <var>element</var> as the first argument and <var>reference</var> as the second argument.

  The <dfn method for="HTMLOptionsCollection"><code>remove(<var>index</var>)</code></dfn> method must act according to the following
  algorithm:

  1. If the number of nodes <a>represented by the collection</a> is zero, abort these steps.
  2. If <var>index</var> is not a number greater than or equal to 0 and less than the number of
      nodes <a>represented by the collection</a>, abort these steps.
  3. Let <var>element</var> be the <var>index</var>th element in the collection.
  4. Remove <var>element</var> from its parent node.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLOptionsCollection"><code>selectedIndex</code></dfn> IDL attribute must act like the identically named

<h4 id="transferable-objects">Transferable objects</h4>

  Some objects support being copied and closed in one operation. This is called <i>transferring</i>
  the object, and is used in particular to transfer ownership of unsharable or expensive resources
  across document and worker boundaries, including across documents of different <a>origins</a>.

  The following <code>Transferable</code> types exist:

  * {{ArrayBuffer}} [[!ECMA-262]]
  * {{CanvasProxy}} (defined in this specification)
  * {{MessagePort}}

  The following IDL block formalizes this:

  To <dfn lt="transfer|transfer a transferrable object|transferred">transfer a <code>Transferable</code> object</dfn> to a new owner, the user agent must run
  the steps defined for the type of object in question. The steps will return a new object of the

  and non-idempotent operation; once an object has been transferred, it cannot be transferred, or
  indeed used, again.)

  To <a>transfer</a> an <code>ArrayBuffer</code> object <var>old</var> to a new owner
  <var>owner</var>, a user agent must create a new <code>ArrayBuffer</code> object pointing at the

  <h4 id="safe-passing-of-structured-data">Safe passing of structured data</h4>

  When a user agent is required to obtain a <dfn>structured clone</dfn> of a value, optionally with
  a <i>transfer map</i>, it must run the following algorithm, which either returns a separate value,
  or throws an exception. If a <i>transfer map</i> is provided, it consists of an association list
  of <code>Transferable</code> objects to placeholder objects.

  1. Let <var>input</var> be the value being cloned.
  2. Let <var>transfer map</var> be the <i>transfer map</i> passed to the algorithm, if any, or the
      empty list otherwise.
  3. Let <var>memory</var> be an association list of pairs of objects, initially empty. This is used
      to handle duplicate references. In each pair of objects, one is called the <i>source</i>
      object and the other the <i>destination</i> object.
  4. For each mapping in <var>transfer map</var>, add a mapping from the <code>Transferable</code>
      object (the source object) to the placeholder object (the destination object) to
      <var>memory</var>.
  5. Let <var>output</var> be the value resulting from calling the <a>internal structured cloning
      algorithm</a> with <var>input</var> as the "<var>input</var>" argument, and
      <var>memory</var> as the "<var>memory</var>" argument.
  6. Return <var>output</var>.

  The <dfn>internal structured cloning algorithm</dfn> is always called with two arguments,
  <var>input</var> and <var>memory</var>, and its behavior is as follows:

  1. If <var>input</var> is the source object of a pair of objects in <var>memory</var>, then return
      the destination object in that pair of objects and abort these steps.
  2. If <var>input</var> is a primitive value, then return that value and abort these steps.

          method of a property involved executing script, and that script threw an uncaught
          exception, then abort the overall <a>structured clone</a> algorithm, with that exception
          being passed through to the caller.
      3. Let <var>cloned value</var> be the result of invoking the

          If this results in an exception, then abort the overall <a>structured clone</a> algorithm,
          with that exception being passed through to the caller.

          <var>name</var>, <var>cloned value</var>).

      The order of the properties in the <var>input</var> and <var>output</var> objects must be the
      same, and any properties whose \[[Get]] internal method involves running script must be
      processed in that same order.

        Property descriptors, setters, getters, and analogous features are not copied in this
        process. For example, the property in the input could be marked as read-only, but in the
        output it would just have the default state (typically read-write, though that could depend
        on the scripting environment).

      <p class="note">
        Properties of Array objects are not treated any differently than those of other Objects. In
        particular, this means that non-index properties of arrays are copied as well.

  There is an <dfn>implied strong reference</dfn> from any IDL attribute that returns a pre-existing
  object to that object.

  <div class="example">
    For example, the <code>document.location</code> attribute means that there is a strong reference
    from a {{Document}} object to its <code>Location</code> object. Similarly, there is
    always a strong reference from a {{Document}} to any descendant nodes, and from any
    node to its owner {{Document}}.

  <hr />

  Data mining tools and other user agents that perform operations on content without running
  scripts, evaluating CSS or XPath expressions, or otherwise exposing the resulting DOM to arbitrary
  content, may "support namespaces" by just asserting that their DOM node analogs are in certain
  namespaces, without actually exposing the above strings.

  <hr />

  <p class="note">
    In <a href="#syntax">the HTML syntax</a>, namespace prefixes and namespace declarations do not have the same
    effect as in XML. For instance, the colon has no special meaning in HTML element names.
