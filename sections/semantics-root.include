  The <{html}> element <a>represents</a> the root of an HTML document.

  Authors are encouraged to specify a <{global/lang}> attribute on the root <{html}> element, giving
  the document's language. This aids speech synthesis tools to determine what pronunciations to use,
  translation tools to determine what rules to use, and so forth.
  
  <p>The <dfn element-attr for="html"><code>manifest</code></dfn> attribute gives the address of the 
  document's <span>application cache</span> <span>manifest</span>, if there is one. If the attribute is present, 
  the attribute's value must be a <a>valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces</a>.</p>

  Advisement: The <span>manifest</span>-based <span>application cache</span> feature is in the
  process of being removed from the Web platform. (This is a long process that takes many years.)
  Using the <span>application cache</span> feature at this time is highly discouraged. Use service
  workers instead. [[SERVICE-WORKERS]]

  <p>The <{html/manifest}> attribute only <span>has an effect</span> during the early stages of document load. 
  Changing the attribute dynamically thus has no effect (and thus, no DOM API is provided for this 
  attribute).</p>
  
  <p class="note">For the purposes of <span>application cache</span> selection, later <{base}> elements 
  cannot affect the <a lt="parse a URL">parsing of URLs</a> in <{html/manifest}> attributes, as the 
  attributes are processed before those elements are seen.</p>
  
  <p class="note">The <span><code>window.applicationCache</code></span> IDL attribute provides scripted 
  access to the offline <span>application cache</span> mechanism.</p>
  
  <p class="note">
    It is recommended to keep the usage of attributes and their values defined on the <{html}>
    element to a minimum to allow for proper detection of the <a>character encoding declaration</a>
    within the first 1024 bytes.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    The <{html}> element in the following example declares that the document's language is
    English.

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;!DOCTYPE html>
      &lt;html lang="en">
        &lt;head>
          &lt;title>Swapping Songs&lt;/title>
        &lt;/head>
        &lt;body>
          &lt;h1>Swapping Songs&lt;/h1>
          &lt;p>Tonight I swapped some of the songs I wrote with some friends, who
          gave me some of the songs they wrote. I love sharing my music.&lt;/p>
        &lt;/body>
      &lt;/html>
