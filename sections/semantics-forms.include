  A form is a component of a Web page that has form controls, such as text fields, buttons,
  checkboxes, range controls, or color pickers. A user can interact with such a form, providing
  data that can then be sent to the server for further processing (e.g., returning the results of
  a search or calculation). No client-side scripting is needed in many cases, though an API is
  available so that scripts can augment the user experience or use forms for purposes other than
  submitting data to a server.

  Writing a form consists of several steps, which can be performed in any order: writing the user
  interface, implementing the server-side processing, and configuring the user interface to
  communicate with the server.

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  For the purposes of this brief introduction, we will create a pizza ordering form.

  Any form starts with a <{form}> element, inside which are placed the controls. Most controls are
  represented by the <{input}> element, which by default provides a one-line text field. To label
  a control, the <{label}> element is used. One way to associate a label with a control is to nest
  the label text, and the control itself, inside a <{label}> element. Each area within a form is
  typically represented using a <{div}> element. Putting this all together, here is how one might
  ask for the customer's name:

  <xmp highlight="html">
    <form>
      <div>
        <label>
          Customer name: <input>
        </label>
      </div>
    </form>
  </xmp>

  <p class="note">
    For an alternate method to associate a <{label}> with a form control, please refer to the
    <code>label</code>'s <{label/for}> attribute.
  </p>

  To assist users with entering their names, an <{input/autocapitalize}> attribute with the value
  of "words" can be added to the <{input}> so that user agents are provided a suggestion to
  automatically capitalize the first character(s) of a user's entered name.

  <xmp highlight="html">
    <form>
      <div>
        <label>
          Customer name: <input autocapitalize="words">
        </label>
      </div>
    </form>
  </xmp>

  To let the user select the size of the pizza, we can use a set of radio buttons. Radio buttons
  also use the <{input}> element, but with a <{input/type}> attribute with the value
  <code>radio</code>. To make the radio buttons work as a group, they are each given a common name
  using the <{input/name}> attribute. To group a batch of controls together, such as, in this
  case, the radio buttons, one can use the <{fieldset}> element. The title of such a group of
  controls is given by the first element in the <{fieldset}>, which has to be a <{legend}> element.

  <xmp highlight="html">
    <form>
      <div>
        <label>
          Customer name: <input autocapitalize="words">
        </label>
      </div>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Pizza Size</legend>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <label>
              <input type="radio" name="size"> Small
            </label>
          </li>
          <li>
            <label>
              <input type="radio" name="size"> Large
            </label>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </fieldset>
    </form>
  </xmp>

  To choose toppings, checkboxes can be added to this form. Checkboxes use the <{input}> element
  with a <{input/type}> attribute with the value <code>checkbox</code>:

  <xmp highlight="html">
    <form>
      <div>
        <label>
          Customer name: <input autocapitalize="words">
        </label>
      </div>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Pizza Size</legend>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <label>
              <input type="radio" name="size"> Small
            </label>
          </li>
          <li>
            <label>
              <input type="radio" name="size"> Large
            </label>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </fieldset>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Pizza Toppings</legend>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <label>
              <input type="checkbox"> Bacon
            </label>
          </li>
          <li>
            <label>
              <input type="checkbox"> Onion
            </label>
          </li>
          <li>
            <label>
              <input type="checkbox"> Mushroom
            </label>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </fieldset>
    </form>
  </xmp>

  In the event there is a problem with a customer's order, the pizzeria needs a way to be able to
  collect the customer's contact information. For this purpose, form controls for telephone numbers
  (<{input}> elements with a <{input/type}> attribute set to <code>tel</code>) and
  e-mail addresses (<{input}> elements with a <{input/type}> attribute set to code>email</code>)
  can be added:

  <xmp highlight="html">
    <form>
      <div>
        <label>
          Customer name: <input autocapitalize="words">
        </label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>
          Telephone: <input type="tel">
        </label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>
          E-mail: <input type="email">
        </label>
      </div>
      ...
    </form>
  </xmp>

  To let customers request a specific delivery time an <{input}> element with its <{input/type}>
  attribute set to <code>time</code> can be used. Many form controls have attributes to help
  authors dictate the values a user can enter; in this case, three attributes of particular
  interest are <{input/min}>, <{input/max}>, and <{input/step}>. Respectively, these set the
  minimum time, the maximum time, and the interval between allowed values (in seconds).

  For this example, the pizzeria only delivers between 11am and 9pm, and allows users to choose a
  delivery window in 15 minute increments. As the <{input/min}>, <{input/max}> attributes take
  values in 24-hour time, this means the <code>min</code> value would be "11:00" and the
  <code>max</code> value would be "21:00". Since the <{input/step}> attribute is set in seconds,
  to set the form control to accept values in 15 minute increments, the 15 minutes would need to
  be converted to seconds (900 seconds).

  <xmp highlight="html">
    <form>
      ...
      <div>
        <label>
          Preferred delivery time:
          <input type="time" min="11:00" max="21:00" step="900">
        </label>
      </div>
    </form>
  </xmp>

  The <{textarea}> element can be used to provide a free-form text field. In this instance, it will
  allow a space for customers to provide delivery instructions:

  <xmp highlight="html">
    <form>
      ...
      <div>
        <label>
          Delivery instructions:
          <textarea></textarea>
        </label>
      </div>
    </form>
  </xmp>

  Finally, to make the form submittable, add a <{button}> element:

  <xmp highlight="html">
    <form>
      <div>
        <label>
          Customer name: <input autocapitalize="words">
        </label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>
          Telephone: <input type="tel">
        </label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>
          E-mail: <input type="email">
        </label>
      </div>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Pizza Size</legend>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <label>
              <input type="radio" name="size"> Small
            </label>
          </li>
          <li>
            <label>
              <input type="radio" name="size"> Large
            </label>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </fieldset>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Pizza Toppings</legend>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <label>
              <input type="checkbox"> Bacon
            </label>
          </li>
          <li>
            <label>
              <input type="checkbox"> Onion
            </label>
          </li>
          <li>
            <label>
              <input type="checkbox"> Mushroom
            </label>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </fieldset>
      <div>
        <label>
          Preferred delivery time:
          <input type="time" min="11:00" max="21:00" step="900">

      </div>
      <div>
        <label>
          Delivery instructions:

      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit order</button>
      </div>
    </form>
  </xmp>

<h5 id="implementing-the-serverside-processing-for-a-form">Implementing the server-side processing for a form</h5>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  The exact details for writing a server-side processor are out of scope for this specification.

  For the purposes of this introduction, we will assume that the script at
  <code>https://pizza.example.com/order</code> is configured to accept submissions using the
  <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> format, expecting the following parameters sent
  in an HTTP POST body:

  : <code>custname</code>
  :: Customer's name
  : <code>custtel</code>
  :: Customer's telephone number
  : <code>custemail</code>
  :: Customer's e-mail
  : <code>size</code>
  :: The pizza size, either <code>small</code> or <code>large</code>
  : <code>topping</code>
  :: A topping, specified once for each selected topping, with the allowed values being
     <code>bacon</code>, <code>onion</code>, and <code>mushroom</code>
  : <code>delivery</code>
  :: The requested delivery time
  : <code>comments</code>
  :: The delivery instructions

<h5 id="configuring-a-form-to-communicate-with-a-server">Configuring a form to communicate with a server</h5>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  <a>Form submissions</a> are exposed to servers in a variety of ways, most commonly as HTTP GET or
  POST requests. To specify the exact method used, the <{form/method}>
  attribute is specified on the <{form}> element. This doesn't specify how the form data is
  encoded, though; to specify that, you use the <{form/enctype}>
  attribute. You also have to specify the [=url/URL=] of the service that will handle the
  submitted data, using the <{form/action}> attribute.

  For each form control you want submitted, you then have to give a name that will be used to
  refer to the data in the submission. We already specified the name for the group of radio buttons;
  the same attribute (<{formelements/name}>) also specifies the submission name.
  Radio buttons can be distinguished from each other in the submission by giving them different
  values, using the <code>value</code> attribute.

  Multiple controls can have the same name; for example, here we give all the checkboxes the same
  name, and the server distinguishes which checkbox was checked by seeing which values are submitted
  with that name — like the radio buttons, they are also given unique values with the
  <code>value</code> attribute.

  Given the settings in the previous section, this all becomes:

  <xmp highlight="html">
    <form method="post" enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded" action="https://pizza.example.com/order">
      <div>
        <label>

            </label>
          </li>
          <li>
            <label>
              <input type="checkbox"> Onion
            </label>
          </li>
          <li>
            <label>
              <input type="checkbox"> Mushroom
            </label>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </fieldset>
      <div>
        <label>
          Preferred delivery time:
          <input type="time" min="11:00" max="21:00" step="900" name="delivery">
        </label>
      </div>
      <div>

      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit order</button>
      </div>
    </form>
  </xmp>

  For example, if the customer entered "Denise Lawrence" as their name, "555-555-8642" as their
  telephone number, did not specify an e-mail, asked for a small pizza, selected the
  Onion and Mushroom toppings, entered a delivery time of 7pm, and left the delivery
  instructions text field blank, the user agent would submit the following to the online Web
  service:

  <pre>custname=Denise+Lawrence&amp;custtel=555-555-8642&amp;custemail=&amp;size=small&amp;topping=onion&amp;topping=mushroom&amp;delivery=19%3A00&amp;comments=</pre>

<h5 id="clientside-form-validation">Client-side form validation</h5>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  Forms can be annotated in such a way that the user agent will check the user's input before the
  form is submitted. The server still has to verify the input is valid (since hostile users can
  easily bypass the form validation), but it allows the user to avoid the wait incurred by having
  the server be the sole checker of the user's input.

  The simplest annotation is the <{input/required}> attribute, which can be specified on <{input}>
  elements to indicate that the form is not to be submitted until a value is given. By adding this
  attribute to the customer name, pizza size, and delivery time fields, we allow the user agent to
  notify the user when the user submits the form without filling in the necessary fields:

  <xmp highlight="html">
    <form method="post" enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded" action="https://pizza.example.com/order">
      <div>
        <label>
          Customer name: <input name="custname" required>
        </label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>
          Telephone: <input type="tel" name="custtel">
        </label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>
          E-mail: <input type="email" name="custemail">
        </label>
      </div>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Pizza Size</legend>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <label>
              <input type="radio" name="size" required> Small

            </label>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </fieldset>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Pizza Toppings</legend>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <label>
              <input type="checkbox" name="topping" value="bacon"> Bacon
            </label>
          </li>
          <li>
            <label>
              <input type="checkbox" name="topping" value="onion"> Onion
            </label>
          </li>
          <li>
            <label>
              <input type="checkbox" name="topping" value="mushroom"> Mushroom
            </label>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </fieldset>
      <div>
        <label>
          Preferred delivery time:
          <input type="time" min="11:00" max="21:00" step="900" name="delivery" required>
        </label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>
          Delivery instructions:
          <textarea name="comments"></textarea>
        </label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit order</button>
      </div>
    </form>
  </xmp>

  It is also possible to limit the length of an input, using the <{input/maxlength}> attribute.
  By adding this to the <{textarea}> element, we can limit users to 1000 characters, preventing
  them from writing huge essays to the busy delivery drivers instead of staying focused and to
  the point:

  <xmp highlight="html">
    ...
      <div>
        <label>
          Delivery instructions:
          <textarea name="comments" maxlength="1000"></textarea>
        </label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <button>Submit order</button>
      </div>
    </form>
  </xmp>

  <p class="note">
    When a form is submitted, <code>invalid</code> events are  fired at each form control that is
    invalid, and then at the <{form}> element itself. This can be useful for displaying a summary
    of the problems with the form, since typically the browser itself will only report one problem
    at a time.
  </p>

<h5 id="enabling-clientside-automatic-filling-of-form-controls">Enabling client-side automatic filling of form controls</h5>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  Some browsers attempt to aid the user by automatically filling form controls rather than having
  the user reenter their information each time. For example, a field asking for the user's telephone
  number can be automatically filled with the user's phone number.

  To help the user agent with this, the <{autocompleteelements/autocomplete}>
  attribute can be used to describe the field's purpose. In the case of this form, we have three
  fields that can be usefully annotated in this way: the information about who the pizza is to be
  delivered to. Adding this information looks like this:

  <xmp highlight="html">
    <form method="post" enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded" action="https://pizza.example.com/order">
      <div>
        <label>
          Customer name:
          <input name="custname" required autocomplete="shipping name">
        </label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>
          Telephone:
          <input type="tel" name="custtel" autocomplete="shipping tel">
        </label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>
          E-mail:
          <input type="email" name="custemail" autocomplete="shipping email">
        </label>
      </div>
      ...
  </xmp>

<h5 id="the-difference-between-the-field-type-the-autofill-field-name-and-the-input-modality">The difference between the field type, the autofill field name, and the input modality</h5>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  The <{input/type}> and <{autocompleteelements/autocomplete}> attributes can seem confusingly
  similar. For instance, in all three cases, the string "<code>email</code>" is a valid value.
  This section attempts to illustrate the difference between the three attributes and provides
  advice suggesting how to use them.

  The <{input/type}> attribute on <{input}> elements decides
  what kind of control the user agent will use to expose the field. Choosing between different
  values of this attribute is the same choice as choosing whether to use an <{input}>
  element, a <{textarea}> element, a <{select}> element, etc.

  The <{autocompleteelements/autocomplete}> attribute, in contrast, describes
  what the value that the user will enter actually represents. Choosing between different values of
  this attribute is the same choice as choosing what the label for the element will be.

  First, consider telephone numbers. If a page is asking for a telephone number from the user,
  the right form control to use is <code>&lt;input type="tel"&gt;</code>.
  However, which <{input/autocomplete}> value to use depends on
  which phone number the page is asking for, whether they expect a telephone number in the
  international format or just the local format, and so forth.

  For example, a page that forms part of a checkout process on an e-commerce site for a customer
  buying a gift to be shipped to a friend might need both the buyer's telephone number (in case of
  payment issues) and the friend's telephone number (in case of delivery issues). If the site
  expects international phone numbers (with the country code prefix), this could thus look like
  this:

  <xmp highlight="html">
    <p>Please enter complete phone numbers including the country code prefix, as in "+1 555 123 4567".</p>
    <div>
      <label>
        Your phone number:
        <input type="tel" name="custtel" autocomplete="billing tel">
      </label>
    </div>
    <div>
      <label>
        Recipient's phone number:
        <input type="tel" name="shiptel" autocomplete="shipping tel">
      </label>
    </div>
  </xmp>

  But if the site only supports British customers and recipients, it might instead look like this
  (notice the use of <code>tel-national</code> rather than <code>tel</code>):

  <xmp highlight="html">
    <p>Please enter complete UK phone numbers, as in "(01632) 960 123".</p>
    <div>
      <label>
        Your phone number:
        <input type="tel" name="custtel" autocomplete="billing tel-national">
      </label>
    </div>
    <div>
      <label>
        Recipient's phone number:
        <input type="tel" name="shiptel" autocomplete="shipping tel-national">
      </label>
    </div>
  </xmp>

  Now, consider a person's preferred languages. The right <{input/autocomplete}> value is
  <code>language</code>. However, there could be a number of different form controls used for
  the purpose: a free text field (<code>&lt;input type="text"&gt;</code>), a drop-down list
  (<code>&lt;select&gt;</code>), radio buttons (<code>&lt;input type="radio"&gt;</code>), etc.
  It only depends on what kind of interface is desired.

<h5 id="date-time-and-number-formats">Date, time, and number formats</h5>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  In this pizza delivery example, the times are specified in the format "HH:MM": two digits for
  the hour, in 24-hour format, and two digits for the time. (Seconds could also be specified,
  though they are not necessary in this example.)

  In some locales, however, times are often expressed differently when presented to users. For
  example, in the United States, it is still common to use the 12-hour clock with an am/pm
  indicator, as in "2pm". In France, it is common to use the 24-hour clock, and separate the
  hours from the minutes using an "h" character, as in "14h00".

  Similar issues exist with dates, with the added complication that even the order of the
  components is not always consistent — for example, in Cyprus the first of February 2003
  would typically be written "1/2/03", while that same date in Japan would typically be written
  as "2003年02月01日"  — and even with numbers, where locales differ, for example, in what
  punctuation is used as the decimal separator and the thousands separator.

  It is therefore important to distinguish the time, date, and number formats used in HTML and in
  form submissions, which are always the formats defined in this specification (and based on the
  well-established ISO 8601 standard for computer-readable date and time formats), from the time,
  date, and number formats presented to the user by the browser and accepted as input from the user
  by the browser.

  The format used "on the wire", i.e. in HTML markup and in form submissions, is intended to be
  computer-readable and consistent irrespective of the user's locale. Dates, for instance, are
  always written in the format "YYYY-MM-DD", as in "2003-02-01". Users are not expected to ever
  see this format.

  The time, date, or number given by the page in the wire format is then translated to the user's
  preferred presentation (based on user preferences or on the locale of the page itself), before
  being displayed to the user. Similarly, after the user inputs a time, date, or number using their
  preferred format, the user agent converts it back to the wire format before putting it in the DOM
  or submitting it.

  This allows scripts in pages and on servers to process times, dates, and numbers in a consistent
  manner without needing to support dozens of different formats, while still supporting the users'
  needs.

  <p class="note">
    See also the <a>implementation notes</a> regarding localization of form controls.
  </p>

  <p class="warning">
    In places that change from, such as Standard Time to Daylight Saving Time, the same time can
    occur twice in the same day when the clocks are moved backwards.
    An <{input}> element with a <{input/type}> of <code>datetime-local</code> or <code>time</code>
    cannot differentiate between two identical instances of time.
    If this difference matters, applications should allow users to specify which occurrence of the
    duplicated time they mean, for example by choosing between "Winter time" and "Summer Time".
  </p>

<h4 id="form-categories">Categories</h4>

  Mostly for historical reasons, elements in this section fall into several overlapping (but
  subtly different) categories in addition to the usual ones like <a>flow content</a>,
  <a>phrasing content</a>, and <a>interactive content</a>.

  A number of the elements are
  <dfn lt="form-associated elements|form-associated">form-associated elements</dfn>,
  which means they can have a <a>form owner</a>.

  <ul class="brief category-list">
    <li><{button}></li>
    <li><{fieldset}></li>
    <li><{input}></li>
    <li><{label}></li>
    <li><{output}></li>
    <li><{select}></li>
    <li><{textarea}></li>
    <li><{img}></li>
  </ul>

  The <a>form-associated elements</a> fall into several subcategories:

  <dl>

    <dt><dfn lt="Listed element|Listed elements">Listed elements</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    Denotes elements that are listed in the <code><var>form</var>.elements</code> and
    <code><var>fieldset</var>.elements</code> APIs.

    <ul class="brief category-list">
      <li><{button}></li>
      <li><{fieldset}></li>
      <li><{input}></li>
      <li><{output}></li>
      <li><{select}></li>
      <li><{textarea}></li>
    </ul>

    </dd>

    <dt><dfn lt="Submittable element|Submittable elements|submittable">Submittable elements</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    Denotes elements that can be used for <a>constructing the form data set</a> when a
    <{form}> element is <a>submitted</a>.

    <ul class="brief category-list">
      <li><{button}></li>
      <li><{input}></li>
      <li><{select}></li>
      <li><{textarea}></li>
    </ul>

    Some <a>submittable elements</a> can be, depending on their attributes, <dfn>buttons</dfn>.
    The prose below defines when an element is a button. Some buttons are specifically
    <dfn lt="submit button|submit buttons">submit buttons</dfn>.

    </dd>

    <dt><dfn lt="Resettable element|Resettable elements|resettable">Resettable elements</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    Denotes elements that can be affected when a <{form}> element is <a>reset</a>.

    <ul class="brief category-list">
      <li><{input}></li>
      <li><{output}></li>
      <li><{select}></li>
      <li><{textarea}></li>
    </ul>

    </dd>

    <dt><dfn lt="Reassociateable element|Reassociateable elements|reassociateable">Reassociateable elements</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    Denotes elements that have a <{formelements/form}> content attribute, and a
    matching {{FormIDLAttribute/form}} IDL attribute, that allow authors to specify an
    explicit <a>form owner</a>.

    <ul class="brief category-list">
      <li><{button}></li>
      <li><{fieldset}></li>
      <li><{input}></li>

      <li><{select}></li>
      <li><{textarea}></li>
    </ul>

    </dd>

  </dl>

  Some elements, not all of them <a>form-associated</a>, are categorized as
  <dfn lt="labelable element|labelable elements|labelable">labelable elements</dfn>.
  These are elements that can be associated with a <{label}> element.

  <ul class="brief category-list">
    <li><{button}></li>
    <li><{input}> (if the <{input/type}> attribute is <em>not</em> in the <{input/Hidden}> state)</li>
    <li><{meter}></li>
    <li><{output}></li>
    <li><{progress}></li>
    <li><{select}></li>
    <li><{textarea}></li>
  </ul>

  The <{form}> element <a>represents</a> a collection of <a>form-associated elements</a>, some of
  which can represent editable values that can be submitted to a server for processing.

  The <dfn element-attr for="form"><code>accept-charset</code></dfn> content attribute gives the
  character encodings that are to be used for the submission. If specified, the value must be an
  <a>ordered set of unique space-separated tokens</a> that are <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a>, and
  each token must be an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for one of the
  <a lt="character encoding">labels</a> of an <a>ASCII-compatible encoding</a>. [[!ENCODING]]

  The <dfn element-attr for="form"><code>name</code></dfn> content attribute represents the
  <{form}>'s name within the {{Document/forms}} collection. The
  value must not be the empty string, and the value must be unique amongst the <{form}>
  elements in the {{Document/forms}} collection that it is in, if any.

  The <{form/autocomplete}> content attribute is an <a>enumerated attribute</a>.
  The attribute has two states. The <dfn attr-value for="form/autocomplete"><code>on</code></dfn>
  keyword maps to the <dfn state for="form/autocomplete">on</dfn> state, and the
  <dfn attr-value for="form/autocomplete"><code>off</code></dfn> keyword maps to the
  <dfn state for="form/autocomplete">off</dfn> state. The attribute may also be omitted.
  The <i>missing value default</i> is the <a state for="form/autocomplete">on</a> state.
  The <a state for="form/autocomplete">off</a> state indicates that by default, form controls
  in the form will have their <a>autofill field name</a> set to "<code>off</code>";
  the <a state for="form/autocomplete">on</a> state indicates that by default, form controls
  in the form will have their <a>autofill field name</a> set to "<code>on</code>".

  The <{form/action}>, <{form/enctype}>, <{form/method}>, <{form/enctype}>, <{form/novalidate}>,
  and <{form/target}> attributes are <a>attributes for form submission</a>.

  <dl class="domintro">

  Each <{form}> element has a mapping of names to elements called the <dfn>past names map</dfn>.
  It is used to persist names of controls even when they change names.

  The <a spec="webidl">supported property names</a> consist of the names obtained from the

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>sourced names</var> be an initially empty ordered list of tuples consisting
    of a string, an element, a source, where the source is either <i>id</i>, <i>name</i>, or
    <i>past</i>, and, if the source is <i>past</i>, an age.</li>

    <li>

    For each <a>listed element</a> <var>candidate</var> whose <a>form owner</a> is the
    <{form}> element, with the exception of any <{input}> elements whose <{input/type}>
    attribute is in the <{input/Image|Image Button}> state, run these substeps:

    <ol>

      <li>If <var>candidate</var> has an <{global/id}> attribute, add an entry to
      <var>sourced names</var> with that <{global/id}> attribute's value as the string,
      <var>candidate</var> as the element, and <i>id</i> as the source.</li>

      <li>If <var>candidate</var> has a <{input/name}> attribute, add an entry to
      <var>sourced names</var> with that <{input/name}> attribute's value as the string,

  The properties exposed in this way must be <a>unenumerable</a>.

  When a <{form}> element is <dfn>indexed for named property retrieval</dfn>, the user agent must
  run the following steps:

    1. Let <var>candidates</var> be a <a>live</a> <code>RadioNodeList</code> object containing all
        the <a>listed elements</a> whose <a>form owner</a> is the <{form}> element that have either
        an <{global/id}> attribute or a <{formelements/name}> attribute equal to <var>name</var>,
        with the exception of <{input}> elements whose <{input/type}> attribute is in the
        <{input/Image|Image Button}> state, in <a>tree order</a>.
    2. If <var>candidates</var> is empty, let <var>candidates</var> be a <a>live</a>
        <code>RadioNodeList</code> object containing all the <{img}> elements that are descendants
        of the <{form}> element and that have either an <{global/id}> attribute or a
        <{formelements/name}> attribute equal to <var>name</var>, in <a>tree order</a>.
    3. If <var>candidates</var> is empty, <var>name</var> is the name of one of the entries in the
        <{form}> element's <a>past names map</a>: return the object associated with <var>name</var>
        in that map.
    4. If <var>candidates</var> contains more than one node, return <var>candidates</var> and abort
        these steps.
    5. Otherwise, <var>candidates</var> contains exactly one node. Add a mapping from
        <var>name</var> to the node in <var>candidates</var> in the <{form}> element's
        <a>past names map</a>, replacing the previous entry with the same name, if any.
    6. Return the node in <var>candidates</var>.

  If an element listed in a <{form}> element's <a>past names map</a> changes <a>form owner</a>, then
  its entries must be removed from that map.

  <hr />

  The <dfn method for="HTMLFormElement"><code>submit()</code></dfn> method, when invoked, must
  <a>submit</a> the <{form}> element from the <{form}> element itself, with the <var>submitted from
  {{HTMLFormElement/submit()}} method</var> flag set.

  The <dfn method for="HTMLFormElement"><code>reset()</code></dfn> method, when invoked, must run
  the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>If the <{form}> element is marked as <i>locked for reset</i>, then abort these
    steps.</li>

    <li>Mark the <{form}> element as <dfn>locked for reset</dfn>.</li>

    <li><a>Reset</a> the <{form}> element.</li>

    <li>Unmark the <{form}> element as <i>locked for reset</i>.</li>

  </ol>

  If the <dfn method for="HTMLFormElement"><code>checkValidity()</code></dfn> method is
  invoked, the user agent must <a>statically validate the constraints</a> of the
  <{form}> element, and return true if the constraint validation return a <i>positive</i>
  result, and false if it returned a <i>negative</i> result.

  If the <dfn method for="HTMLFormElement"><code>reportValidity()</code></dfn> method is invoked,
  the user agent must <a>interactively validate the constraints</a> of the <{form}> element, and
  return true if the constraint validation return a <i>positive</i> result, and false if it
  returned a <i>negative</i> result.

  The <{label}> element <a>represents</a> a caption in a user interface. The caption can be
  associated with a specific form control, known as the <{label}> element's
  <dfn>labeled control</dfn>, either using the <{label/for}> attribute, or by putting the
  form control inside the <{label}> element itself.

  Except where otherwise specified by the following rules, a <{label}> element has no
  <a>labeled control</a>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="label"><code>for</code></dfn> attribute may be specified to indicate a
  form control with which the caption is to be associated. If the attribute is specified, the
  attribute's value must be the <a>ID</a> of a <a>labelable element</a> in the same {{Document}}
  as the <{label}> element. If the attribute is specified and there is an element in the
  {{Document}} whose <a>ID</a> is equal to the value of the <{label/for}> attribute, and the
  first such element is a <a>labelable element</a>, then that element is the <{label}> element's
  <a>labeled control</a>.

  <div class="example">
    The following examples showcase <{label/for}> attributes being used to associate <{label}>s
    with the form controls that are not a child elements of the <{label}>s. The first example is of a simple form to input the full name of a user.

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <form>
        <div>
          <label for="fname">
            Full name:
          </label>
          <input type="text" name="fullname" id="fname">
        </div>
        ...
      </form>
    </xmp>

    The second example shows how an author could use a <{label/for}> attribute to associate a
    <{label}> with a form control, within the context of a <{table}> element.

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <form>
        <table>
          <caption>Manage Customers</caption>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>
                Archive
              </th>
              <th>
                Customer Name
              </th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>
                <input type="checkbox" id="c1" name="customer1">
              </td>
              <td>
                <label for="c1">Laura Nelson</label>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <!-- ... -->
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <button type="submit">Archive customers</button>
      </form>
    </xmp>

    <p class="note">
      The <{global/id}> attribute is required to associate the <{label/for}> attribute,
      while the <{label/name}> attribute is required so the value of the input will be submitted
      as part of the form.
    </p>
  </div>

  If the <{label/for}> attribute is not specified, but the <{label}> element has a
  <a>labelable element</a> descendant, then the first such descendant in <a>tree order</a> is the
  <{label}> element's <a>labeled control</a>.

  The <{label}> element's <a>activation behavior</a> should match the platform's label behavior.
  Similarly, any additional presentation hints should match the platform's label presentation.

  <div class="example">
    On many platforms activating a checkbox label checks the checkbox, while activating a
    text input's label focuses the input. Clicking the <{label}> "Lost" in the following
    snippet could trigger the user agent to <a>run synthetic click activation steps</a>
    on the checkbox, as if the element itself had been triggered by the user, while clicking
    the <{label}> "Where?" would <a>queue a task</a> that runs the <a>focusing steps</a>
    for the element to the text input:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <div>
        <input type="checkbox" name="lost">
        <label>Lost</label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>Where?</label>
        <input type="text" name="where">
      </div>
    </xmp>

  </div>

  If a <{label}> element has <a>interactive content</a> other than its <a>labeled control</a>,
  the <a>activation behavior</a> of the <{label}> element for events targeted  at those
  <a>interactive content</a> descendants and any descendants of those must be to do nothing.

  <div class="example">
    <p>In the following example, clicking on the link does not toggle the checkbox,
    even if the platform normally toggles a checkbox when clicking on a label.
    Instead, clicking the link triggers the normal <a>activation behavior</a> of following the link.</p>
    <xmp class="bad" highlight="html">
      <!-- bad example - link inside label reduces checkbox activation area -->
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="tac">
        I agree to <a href="tandc.html">the terms and conditions</a>
      </label>
    </xmp>
  </div>

  <p class="note">
    The ability to click or press a <{label}> to trigger an event on a control provides
    usability and accessibility benefits by increasing the <em>hit area</em> of a control,
    making it easier for a user to operate.
    These benefits may be lost or reduced, if the <{label}> element contains an element with
    its own activation behavior, such as a link:

    <div class="example">
      <xmp class="bad" highlight="html">
        <!-- bad example - all label text inside the link reduces activation area to checkbox only -->
        <label>
          <input type="checkbox" name="tac">
          <a href="tandc.html">I agree to the terms and conditions</a>
        </label>
      </xmp>

      The usability and accessibility benefits can be maintained by placing such elements outside
      the <{label}> element:

      <xmp highlight="html">
        <!-- good example - link outside label means checkbox activation area includes the checkbox and all the label text -->
        <label>
          <input type="checkbox" name="tac">
          I agree to the terms and conditions
        </label>
        (read <a href="tandc.html">Terms and Conditions</a>)
      </xmp>
    </div>
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    The following example has three form controls, each within a label. Two of the form controls
    have accompanying small text describing the expected format for users to follow when entering
    their information.

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <div>

  element. It is an <a>enumerated attribute</a>. The data type is used to select the control to
  use for the <{input}>. Some data types allow either a text field or combo box control to be used,
  based on the absence or presence of a <{input/list}> attribute on the element.
  The following table lists the keywords and states for the attribute — the keywords in the
  left column map to the state, data type and control(s) in the cells on the same row.

    <small>† If the control has no text field, the {{HTMLInputElement/select()}} method
    results in a no-op, with no "{{InvalidStateError}}" <code>DOMException</code>.</small>
  </p>

  Some states of the <{input/type}> attribute define a <dfn>value sanitization algorithm</dfn>.

  Each <{input}> element has a <a for="forms">value</a>, which is
  exposed by the {{HTMLInputElement/value}} IDL attribute. Some states define an
  <dfn>algorithm to convert a string to a number</dfn>,
  an <dfn>algorithm to convert a number to a
  string</dfn>, an <dfn>algorithm to convert a string to a
  {{Date}} object</dfn>, and an <dfn>algorithm to
  convert a {{Date}} object to a string</dfn>, which are used by <{input/max}>, <{input/min}>, <{input/step}>, {{HTMLInputElement/valueAsDate}},
  {{HTMLInputElement/valueAsNumber}},
  {{HTMLInputElement/stepDown()}}, and {{HTMLInputElement/stepUp()}}.

  Each <{input}> element has a boolean <dfn for="input">dirty value flag</dfn>. The
  <a for="input">dirty value flag</a> must be initially set to false when the element is created,
  and must be set to true whenever the user interacts with the control in a way that changes the
  <a for="forms">value</a>. (It is also set to true when the value is programmatically changed,
  as described in the definition of the {{HTMLInputElement/value}} IDL attribute.)

  The <dfn element-attr for="input"><code>value</code></dfn> content attribute gives the default
  <a for="forms">value</a> of the <{input}> element. When the <{input/value}> content attribute is
  added, set, or removed, if the control's <a for="input">dirty value flag</a>
  is false, the user agent must set the <a for="forms">value</a> of the element
  to the value of the <{input/value}> content attribute, if there is
  one, or the empty string otherwise, and then run the current
  <a>value sanitization algorithm</a>, if one is defined.

  Each <{input}> element has a <a for="forms">checkedness</a>,
  which is exposed by the {{HTMLInputElement/checked}} IDL attribute.

  Each <{input}> element has a boolean <dfn>dirty checkedness flag</dfn>. When it is true, the
  element is said to have a <dfn><i>dirty checkedness</i></dfn>.
  The <a>dirty checkedness flag</a> must be initially set to false when the element is created,
  and must be set to true whenever the user interacts with the control in a way that changes
  the <a for="forms">checkedness</a>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="input"><code>checked</code></dfn> content attribute is a
  <a>boolean attribute</a> that gives the default <a for="forms">checkedness</a> of the
  <{input}> element. When the <{input/checked}> content attribute is added, if the control does
  not have <i>dirty checkedness</i>, the user agent must set the <a for="forms">checkedness</a>
  of the element to true; when the <{input/checked}> content attribute is removed, if
  the control does not have <i>dirty checkedness</i>, the user
  agent must set the <a for="forms">checkedness</a> of the element to false.

  The <a>reset algorithm</a> for <{input}> elements is to set the
  <a for="input">dirty value flag</a> and <a>dirty checkedness flag</a> back to false, set
  the <a for="forms">value</a> of the element to the value of the <{input/value}> content
  attribute, if there is one, or the empty string otherwise, set the
  <a for="forms">checkedness</a> of the element to true if the element has a <{input/checked}>
  content attribute and false if it does not, empty the list of <a>selected files</a>, and then
  invoke the <a>value sanitization algorithm</a>, if the <{input/type}> attribute's current
  state defines one.

  Each <{input}> element can be <a>mutable</a>. Except where
  otherwise specified, an <{input}> element is always <a>mutable</a>. Similarly,
  except where otherwise specified, the user agent should not allow the user to
  modify the element's <a for="forms">value</a> or <a for="forms">checkedness</a>.

  When an <{input}> element is disabled, it is not <a>mutable</a>.

  <p class="note">
    The <{input/readonly}> attribute can also in some
  cases (e.g., for the <{input/Date}> state, but not the <{input/Checkbox}> state) stop an
  <{input}> element from being <a>mutable</a>.
  </p>

  The <a>cloning steps</a> for <{input}> elements must propagate the <a for="forms">value</a>,
  <a for="input">dirty value flag</a>, <a for="forms">checkedness</a>, and
  <a>dirty checkedness flag</a> from the node being cloned to the copy.

  <hr />

  When an <{input}> element is first created, the element's rendering and behavior must
  be set to the rendering and behavior defined for the <{input/type}>
  attribute's state, and the <a>value sanitization algorithm</a>, if one is defined for the
  <{input/type}> attribute's state, must be invoked.

  </div>

  <div id="input-type-change">

  When an <{input}> element's <{input/type}> attribute
  changes state, the user agent must run the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>If the previous state of the element's <{input/type}> attribute
    put the {{HTMLInputElement/value}} IDL attribute in the <i>value</i> mode, and the element's <a for="forms">value</a>
    is not the empty string, and the new state of the element's <{input/type}> attribute puts the {{HTMLInputElement/value}}
    IDL attribute in either the <i>default</i> mode or the <i>default/on</i> mode, then set the element's <{input/value}>
    content attribute to the element's <a for="forms">value</a>.</li>

    <li>Otherwise, if the previous state of the element's <{input/type}> attribute put the {{HTMLInputElement/value}}
    IDL attribute in any mode other than the <i>value</i> mode, and the
    new state of the element's <{input/type}> attribute puts the {{HTMLInputElement/value}} IDL attribute in the <i>value</i>
    mode, then set the <a for="forms">value</a> of the element to the value of the <{input/value}> content attribute,
    if there is one, or the empty string
    otherwise, and then set the control's <a for="input">dirty value flag</a> to false.</li>

    <li>Otherwise, if the previous state of the element's <{input/type}> attribute put the {{HTMLInputElement/value}}
    IDL attribute in any mode other than the <i>filename</i> mode, and the new state of the element's <{input/type}>
    attribute puts the {{HTMLInputElement/value}} IDL attribute in the <i>filename</i> mode, then set the

  The <{input/name}> attribute represents the element's name.
  The <{input/dirname}> attribute controls how the element's <a>directionality</a> is submitted.
  The <{input/disabled}> attribute is used to make the control non-interactive and to prevent its value from being submitted.
  The <{input/form}> attribute is used to explicitly associate the <{input}> element with its <a>form owner</a>.
  The <{input/autofocus}> attribute controls focus.
  The <{input/autocapitalize}> attribute provides a hint for the user agent to help the user automatically capitalize text they enter.
  The <{input/autocomplete}> attribute controls how the user agent provides autofill behavior.

  The <{input}> element <a>represents</a> a one line plain text edit control for

  <p class="note">
    The difference between the <{input/Text}> state

  If the element is <a>mutable</a>, the user agent should allow the
  user to change the writing direction of the element, setting it either to a left-to-right writing
  direction or a right-to-left writing direction. If the user does so, the user agent must then run
  the following steps:

  <ol>
    <li>Set the element's <{global/dir}> attribute to "<a attr-value for="global/dir">ltr</a>"
    if the user selected a left-to-right writing direction, and

    <li><a>Queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> that bubbles named <code>input</code> at the <{input}> element.</li>

  <p class="note">
    Unlike the <{input/URL}> and <{input/E-mail}> types, the <{input/Telephone}> type does not enforce a particular syntax. This is
  intentional; in practice, telephone number fields tend to be free-form fields, because there are a
  wide variety of valid phone numbers. Systems that need to enforce a particular format are
  encouraged to use the <code>pattern</code> attribute or the {{HTMLInputElement/setCustomValidity()}} method to hook into the client-side

        <option label="The Single UNIX Specification, Version 3" value="https://www.unix-systems.org/version3/">
      </datalist>
    </xmp>

    ...and the user had typed "<kbd>www.w3</kbd>", and the user agent had also found that the user
    had visited <code>https://www.w3.org/Consortium/#membership</code> and <code>https://www.w3.org/TR/XForms/</code> in the recent past, then the rendering might look
    like this:

    <img src="images/sample-url.png" width="472" height="134" alt="A text box with an icon on the left followed by the text &quot;www.w3&quot; and a cursor, with a drop down button on the right hand side; with, below, a drop down box containing a list of six URLs on the left, with the first four having grayed out labels on the right; and a scroll bar to the right of the drop down box, indicating further values are available." />

    The first four URLs in this sample consist of the four URLs in the author-specified list that
    match the text the user has entered, sorted in some user agent-defined manner (maybe by how frequently
    the user refers to those URLs). Note how the user agent is using the knowledge that the values are URLs
    to allow the user to omit the scheme part and perform intelligent matching on the domain
    name.

    The last two URLs (and probably many more, given the scrollbar's indications of more values
    being available) are the matches from the user agent's session history data. This data is not
    made available to the page DOM. In this particular case, the user agent has no titles to provide for
    those values.

  When an <{input}> element's <{input/type}> attribute is in
  the <{input/E-mail}> state, the rules in this section apply.

  User agents may transform the <a for="forms">values</a> for display and editing.

  User agents should convert punycode in the domain labels of
  the <a for="forms">value</a> to Internationalized Domain Names in the display, and vice versa.

  User agents should allow the user to set the <a for="forms">value</a> to a string that
  is not a <a>valid e-mail address</a> or <a>valid e-mail address list</a>.

  User agents must not allow users to insert U+000A LINE FEED (LF) or U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters
  into the <a for="forms">value</a>.

  Some aspects of how the <{input/E-mail}> state operates depend on whether the
  <code>multiple</code> attribute is present.


  <dl class="switch">

    <dt>When the <code>multiple</code> attribute is not specified on the
    element</dt>

    <dd>

    The <{input}> element <a>represents</a> a control for editing an e-mail
    address given in the element's <a for="forms">value</a>.

    If the element is <a>mutable</a>, the user agent should allow the
    user to change the e-mail address represented by its <a for="forms">value</a>,
    including setting the <a for="forms">value</a> to the empty string.

    The user agent should act in a manner consistent with expecting the user to
    provide a single e-mail address.

    <strong>Constraint validation</strong>: While the user interface is representing input that
    the user agent cannot convert to a valid email address, the control is <a>suffering from bad
    input</a>.

    The <code>value</code> attribute, if specified and not empty, must
    have a value that is a single <a>valid e-mail address</a>.

    <strong>The <a>value sanitization algorithm</a> is as follows</strong>: <a>Strip

    leading and trailing white space</a> from the <a for="forms">value</a>.

    <strong>Constraint validation</strong>: While the <a for="forms">value</a>
    of the element is neither the empty string nor a single <a>valid e-mail address</a>, the
    element is <a>suffering from a type mismatch</a>.


    </dd>

    <dt>When the <code>multiple</code> attribute <em>is</em> specified on
    the element</dt>

    <dd>

    The <{input}> element <a>represents</a> a control for adding, removing, and
    editing a list of e-mail addresses given in the element's <a for="forms">value<em>s</em></a>.

    If the element is <a>mutable</a>, the user agent should allow the
    user to add, remove, and edit the e-mail addresses represented by its <a for="forms">values</a>,
    including removing all addresses and setting the <a for="forms">value</a> to the empty string.

    User agents may allow the user to set any individual value in the
    list of <a for="forms">value<em>s</em></a> to a string that is not a <a>valid e-mail address</a>,
    but must not allow users to set any individual value to a string containing U+002C COMMA (,)
    as well as the U+000A LINE FEED (LF), or U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters.

    <strong>Constraint validation</strong>: While the user interface describes a situation where
    an individual value contains a U+002C COMMA (,) or is representing input that the user agent
    cannot convert to a valid email address, the control is <a>suffering from bad input</a>.

    Whenever the user changes the element's <a for="forms">value<em>s</em></a>,
    the user agent must run the following steps:

    <ol>

      <li>Let <var>latest values</var> be a copy of the element's <a for="forms">value<em>s</em></a>.</li>

      <li><a>Strip leading and trailing white space</a> from each value in <var>latest values</var>.</li>

      <li>Let the element's <a for="forms">value</a> be the result of
      concatenating all the values in <var>latest values</var>, separating each value from
      the next by a single U+002C COMMA character (,), maintaining the list's order.</li>

    </ol>

    The <code>value</code> attribute, if specified, must have a value
    that is a <a>valid e-mail address list</a>.

      (possibly empty) tokens, maintaining the original order.</li>

      <li>Let the element's <a for="forms">value</a> be the result of
      concatenating the element's <a for="forms">values</a>, separating
      each value from the next by a single U+002C COMMA character (,), maintaining the list's
      order.</li>

    </ol>

    <strong>Constraint validation</strong>: While the <a for="forms">value</a>
    of the element is not a <a>valid e-mail address list</a>, the element is <a>suffering

  When the <code>multiple</code> attribute is set or removed, the
  user agent must run the <a>value sanitization algorithm</a>.

  A <dfn>valid e-mail address</dfn> is defined in [[!RFC6531]].

  A user agent should present and consume Unicode text in the user interface, and expose it to other applications,
  except when sending to a Mail Transfer Agent that does not support SMTPUTF8 [[RFC6531]].

  <div class="note">

    This allows fully internationalised email addresses such as <samp>我買@屋企.香港</samp>,

  </div>

  When an <{input}> element's <{input/type}> attribute is in
  the <{input/Date}> state, the rules in this section apply.

  The <{input}> element <a>represents</a> a control for setting the element's
  <a for="forms">value</a> to a string representing a specific <a for="dates">date</a>.

  <p class="note"><a for="dates">date</a> values represent a "floating" time and do
  not include <a>time zone</a> information. Care is needed when
  converting values of this type to or from date data types in JavaScript and other programming
  languages. In many cases, an implicit time-of-day and time zone are used to create a global
  ("incremental") time (an integer value that represents the offset from some arbitrary epoch time).
  Processing or conversion of these values, particularly across time zones, can change the value of
  the date itself. [[TIMEZONE]]</p>

  If the element is <a>mutable</a>, the user agent should allow the
  user to change the <a for="dates">date</a> represented by its <a for="forms">value</a>,
  as obtained by <a>parsing a date</a> from it. User agents must not allow the user to set the
  <a for="forms">value</a> to a non-empty string that is not a <a>valid date string</a>.
  If the user agent provides a user interface for selecting a <a for="dates">date</a>,
  then the <a for="forms">value</a> must be set to a <a>valid date string</a>
  representing the user's selection. User agents should allow
  the user to set the <a for="forms">value</a> to the empty string.

  <strong>Constraint validation</strong>: While the user interface describes input that the user
  agent cannot convert to a <a>valid date string</a>, the control is <a>suffering from bad
  input</a>.

  <p class="note">
    See [[#date-time-and-number-formats]] for a discussion of
  the difference between the input format and submission format for date, time, and number form
  controls, and the <a>implementation notes</a> regarding localization of form controls.
  </p>

  The <code>value</code> attribute, if specified and not empty, must
  have a value that is a <a>valid date string</a>.

  <strong>The <a>value sanitization algorithm</a> is as follows</strong>:
  If the <a for="forms">value</a> of the element is not a <a>valid date string</a>, then
  set it to the empty string instead.

  The <{input/min}> attribute, if specified, must have a value that is
  a <a>valid date string</a>. The <{input/max}> attribute, if
  specified, must have a value that is a <a>valid date string</a>.

  The <{input/step}> attribute is expressed in days. The <a>step scale factor</a>
  is 86,400,000 (which converts the days to milliseconds, which is the base unit of comparison for
  the conversion algorithms below). The <a>default step</a> is 1 day.

  When the element is <a>suffering from a step mismatch</a>, the user agent may round the
  element's <a for="forms">value</a> to the nearest <a for="dates">date</a> for which the element would not <a>suffer from a step mismatch</a>.

  The <code>change</code> event is fired whenever the user selects a new <a>valid date string</a>.
  Moving focus away from the date picker component or explicitly confirming with a button are unambigous triggers that the user wants the value changed.
  The event must be fired on all such cases if the new date value is different than the previous one.

  User agents are not required to firing the event on intermediate values reached as the user cycles through a sequence of values.
  For example, user agents may employ a timeout between changes, to avoid firing too many change events.

  <strong>The <a>algorithm to convert a string to a number</a>, given a string <var>input</var>,
  is as follows</strong>: If <a>parsing a date</a> from <var>input</var> results in an
  error, then return an error; otherwise, return the number of milliseconds elapsed from midnight
  UTC on the morning of 1970-01-01 (the time represented by the value
  "<code>1970-01-01T00:00:00.0Z</code>") to midnight UTC on the morning of the parsed
  <a for="dates">date</a>, ignoring leap seconds.

  <strong>The <a>algorithm to convert a number to a
  string</a>, given a number <var>input</var>, is as follows</strong>: Return a
  <a>valid date string</a> that represents the <a for="dates">date</a> that, in
  UTC, is current <var>input</var> milliseconds after midnight UTC on the morning of
  1970-01-01 (the time represented by the value "<code>1970-01-01T00:00:00.0Z</code>").

  <strong>The <a>algorithm to convert a string to a <code>Date</code> object</a>,

  When an <{input}> element's <{input/type}> attribute is in
  the <a>Week</a> state, the rules in this section apply.

  The <{input}> element <a>represents</a> a control for setting the element's
  <a for="forms">value</a> to a string representing a specific <a>week</a> beginning on a Monday, at midnight UTC.

  If the element is <a>mutable</a>, the user agent should allow the
  user to change the <a>week</a> represented by its <a for="forms">value</a>, as obtained by
  <a>parsing a week</a> from it. User agents must not allow the user to set the
  <a for="forms">value</a> to a non-empty string that is not a
  <a>valid week string</a>. If the user agent provides a user interface for selecting a
  <a>week</a>, then the <a for="forms">value</a> must be set
  to a <a>valid week string</a> representing the user's selection. User agents should allow
  the user to set the <a for="forms">value</a> to the empty string.

  <strong>Constraint validation</strong>: While the user interface describes input that the user
  agent cannot convert to a <a>valid week string</a>, the control is
  <a>suffering from bad input</a>.

  <p class="note">

  the difference between the input format and submission format for date, time, and number form
  controls, and the <a>implementation notes</a> regarding localization of form controls.
  </p>

  The <code>value</code> attribute, if specified and not empty, must
  have a value that is a <a>valid week string</a>.

  <strong>The <a>value sanitization algorithm</a> is as follows</strong>: If the <a for="forms">value</a> of the element is not a <a>valid week string</a>, then
  set it to the empty string instead.

  The <{input/min}> attribute, if specified, must have a value that is
  a <a>valid week string</a>. The <{input/max}> attribute, if
  specified, must have a value that is a <a>valid week string</a>.

  The <{input/step}> attribute is expressed in weeks. The <a>step scale factor</a> is 604,800,000
  (which converts the weeks to milliseconds, which is the base unit of comparison for the conversion
  algorithms below). The <a>default step</a> is 1 week. The <a>default step base</a> is -259,200,000
  (the start of week 1970-W01 which is the Monday 3 days before 1970-01-01).

  When the element is <a>suffering from a step mismatch</a>, the user agent may round the
  element's <a for="forms">value</a> to the nearest <a>week</a> for which the element would not
  <a>suffer from a step mismatch</a>.

  <strong>The <a>algorithm to convert a string to a
  number</a>, given a string <var>input</var>, is as follows</strong>: If
  <a>parsing a week string</a> from <var>input</var> results in
  an error, then return an error; otherwise, return the number of milliseconds elapsed from midnight
  UTC on the morning of 1970-01-01 (the time represented by the value
  "<code>1970-01-01T00:00:00.0Z</code>") to midnight UTC on the morning of the Monday of the
  parsed <a>week</a>, ignoring leap seconds.

  <strong>The <a>algorithm to convert a number to a string</a>, given a number
  <var>input</var>, is as follows</strong>: Return a
  <a>valid week string</a> that represents the <a>week</a> that, in
  UTC, is current <var>input</var> milliseconds after midnight UTC on the morning of
  1970-01-01 (the time represented by the value "<code>1970-01-01T00:00:00.0Z</code>").

  <strong>The <a>algorithm to convert a string to a
  <code>Date</code> object</a>, given a string <var>input</var>, is as follows</strong>:
  If <a>parsing a week</a> from <var>input</var> results
  in an error, then return an error; otherwise, return <a>a new
  <code>Date</code> object</a> representing midnight UTC on the morning of the Monday of the
  parsed <a>week</a>.

  <strong>The <a>algorithm to convert a

 <div class="note" id="only-contemporary-times">

    The <{input/LocalDateTime|Local Date and Time}> state and other date-related states are not
    useful for vague values, and are only useful for dates ranging from recent history through a
    few thousand years. For example, "one millisecond after the big bang", "the Ides of March, 44BC",
    "the early part of the Jurassic period", or "a winter around 250 BCE", and many other expressions
    of time cannot be sensibly expressed in HTML <{form}> states.

    For the input of dates before the introduction of the Gregorian calendar, authors are
    encouraged to not use the <{input/LocalDateTime|Local Date and Time}> state (and
    the other date- and time-related states described in subsequent sections), as user agents are not
    required to support converting dates and times from earlier periods to the Gregorian calendar,
    and asking users to do so manually puts an undue burden on users. (This is complicated by the
    manner in which the Gregorian calendar was phased in, which occurred at different times in
    different countries, ranging from partway through the 16th century all the way to early in the
    20th.) Instead, authors are encouraged to provide fine-grained input controls using the
    <{select}> element and <{input}> elements with the <{input/Number}> state.

  <p class="warning">Applications need to use care when working with <code>datetime-local</code> values,

  <div class="note">
  This specification does not define what user interface user agents are to use; user agent vendors

  a page in the Persian or Arabic languages, a form might support Persian and Arabic style numeric
  input (converting it to the format required for submission as described above). Similarly, a user
  agent showing a page in a French locale might display the value with apostrophes between thousands
  and commas before the decimals, and allow the user to enter a value in that manner, internally
  converting it to the submission format described above.

  See [[#date-time-and-number-formats]] for a discussion of the difference between the input format
  and submission format for date, time, and number form controls, and the
  <a>implementation notes</a> regarding localization of form controls.

  Systems that need to enforce a particular format are encouraged to use the <code>pattern</code>

  <div class="example">
    Here is an example of using a numeric input control:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <label>
        How much do you want to charge?
        $<input type="number" min="0" step="0.01" name="price">
      </label>
    </xmp>

    As described above, a user agent might support numeric input in the user's local format,
    converting it to the format required for submission as described above. This might include
    handling grouping separators (as in "872,000,000,000") and various decimal separators (such as
    "3,99" vs "3.99") or using local digits (such as those in Arabic, Devanagari, Persian, and
    Thai).

  </div>

  <p class="note">
    The <code>type="number"</code> state is not appropriate for input that
  happens to only consist of numbers but isn't strictly speaking a number. For example, it would be
  inappropriate for credit card numbers or US postal codes. A simple way of determining whether to
  use <code>type="number"</code> is to consider whether it would make sense for the input
  control to have a spinbox interface (e.g., with "up" and "down" arrows). Getting a credit card
  number wrong by 1 in the last digit isn't a minor mistake, it's as wrong as getting every digit
  incorrect. So it would not make sense for the user to select a credit card number using "up" and
  "down" buttons. When a spinbox interface is not appropriate, <code>type="text"</code> is
  probably the right choice (possibly with a <code>pattern</code>
  attribute).

  </div>

  When an <{input}> element's <{input/type}> attribute is in the <{input/Range}> state, the rules
  in this section apply.

  The <{input}> element <a>represents</a> a control for setting the element's
  <a for="forms">value</a> to a string representing a number, but with the caveat that the exact
  value is not important, letting user agents provide a simpler interface than they do for the
  <{input/Number}> state.

  If the element is <a>mutable</a>, the user agent should allow the user to change the number
  represented by its <a for="forms">value</a>, as obtained from applying the
  <a>rules for parsing floating-point number values</a> to it. User agents must not allow the user
  to set the <a for="forms">value</a> to a string that is not a <a>valid floating-point number</a>.
  If the user agent provides a user interface for selecting a number, then the
  <a for="forms">value</a> must be set to a
  <a lt="best floating-point number">best representation of the number representing the user's selection as a floating-point number</a>.
  User agents must not allow the user to set the <a for="forms">value</a> to the empty string.

  <strong>Constraint validation</strong>: While the user interface describes input that the user
  agent cannot convert to a <a>valid floating-point number</a>, the control is
  <a>suffering from bad input</a>.

  The <{input/value}> attribute, if specified, must have a value that is a
  <a>valid floating-point number</a>.

  <strong>The <a>value sanitization algorithm</a> is as follows</strong>: If the
  <a for="forms">value</a> of the element is not a <a>valid floating-point number</a>,
  then set it to the
  <a lt="best floating-point number">best representation, as a floating-point number</a>,
  of the <a for="range">default value</a>.

  The <dfn for="range">default value</dfn> is the <a>minimum</a> plus half the difference between
  the <a>minimum</a> and the <a>maximum</a>, unless the <a>maximum</a> is less than the
  <a>minimum</a>, in which case the <a for="range">default value</a> is the <a>minimum</a>.

  When the element is <a>suffering from an underflow</a>, the user agent must set the element's
  <a for="forms">value</a> to the
  <a lt="best floating-point number">best representation, as a floating-point number</a>,
  of the <a>minimum</a>.

  When the element is <a>suffering from an overflow</a>, if the <a>maximum</a> is not less
  than the <a>minimum</a>, the user agent must set the element's <a for="forms">value</a>
  to a <a>valid floating-point number</a> that represents the <a>maximum</a>.

  When the element is <a>suffering from a step mismatch</a>, the user agent must round the
  element's <a for="forms">value</a> to the nearest number for which the element would not
  <a>suffer from a step mismatch</a>, and which is greater than or equal to the <a>minimum</a>,
  and, if the <a>maximum</a> is not less than the <a>minimum</a>, which is less than or equal
  to the <a>maximum</a>, if there is a number that matches these constraints. If two numbers
  match these constraints, then user agents must use the one nearest to positive infinity.

  <div class="example">
    For example, the following markup results in a range control whose initial value is 60:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <input type="range" min="0" max="100" step="20" value="50">
    </xmp>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    Here is an example of a range control using an autocomplete list with the <{input/list}>
    attribute. This could be useful if there are values along the full range of the control that
    are especially important, such as preconfigured light levels or typical speed limits in a range
    control used as a speed control. The following markup fragment:

    <pre highlight="html">
&lt;input type="range" min="-100" max="100" value="0" step="10" name="power" list="powers"&gt;
&lt;datalist id="powers"&gt;
  &lt;option value="0"&gt;
  &lt;option value="-30"&gt;
  &lt;option value="30"&gt;
  <mark>&lt;option value="++50"&gt;</mark>
&lt;/datalist&gt;
    </pre>

    ...with the following style sheet applied:

    <xmp highlight="css">
      input[type="range"] { height: 75px; width: 49px; background: #D5CCBB; color: #000; }
    </xmp>

    ...might render as:

    <img src="images/sample-range.png" width="49" height="75" alt="A vertical slider control whose primary color is black and whose background color is beige, with the slider having five tick marks, one long one at each extremity, and three short ones clustered around the midpoint." />

    Note how the user agent determined the orientation of the control from the ratio of the
    style-sheet-specified height and width properties. The colors were similarly derived from the
    style sheet. The tick marks, however, were derived from the markup. In particular, the
    <{input/step}> attribute has not affected the placement of tick marks, the user agent deciding
    to only use the author-specified completion values and then adding longer tick marks at the
    extremes.

    Note how the invalid value <code>++50</code> was completely ignored.
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    For another example, consider the following markup fragment:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <input name="x" type="range" min="100" max="700" step="9.09090909" value="509.090909">
    </xmp>

    A user agent could display in a variety of ways, for instance:

    <img src="images/sample-range-2a.png" width="231" height="57" alt="As a dial." />

    Or, alternatively, for instance:

    <img src="images/sample-range-2b.png" width="445" height="56" alt="As a long horizontal slider with tick marks." />

    The user agent could pick which one to display based on the dimensions given in the style sheet.
    This would allow it to maintain the same resolution for the tick marks, despite the differences
    in width.
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    Finally, here is an example of a range control with two labeled values:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <input type="range" name="a" list="a-values">
      <datalist id="a-values">
        <option value="10" label="Low">
        <option value="90" label="High">
      </datalist>
    </xmp>

    With styles that make the control draw vertically, it might look as follows:

    <img src="images/sample-range-labels.png" width="103" height="164" alt="A vertical slider control with two tick marks, one near the top labeled 'High', and one near the bottom labeled 'Low'." />
  </div>

  <p class="note">
    In this state, the range and step constraints are enforced even during user input,
    and there is no way to set the value to the empty string.
  </p>

  The <{input/min}> attribute, if specified, must have a value that is a
  <a>valid floating-point number</a>. The <a>default minimum</a> is 0. The <{input/max}> attribute,
  if specified, must have a value that is a <a>valid floating-point number</a>.
  The <a>default maximum</a> is 100.

  The <a>step scale factor</a> is 1. The <a>default step</a> is 1 (allowing only integers, unless
  the <{input/min}> attribute has a non-integer value).

  </ul>

  A document must not contain an <{input}> element whose <i>radio button group</i>
  contains only that element.

  When any of the following phenomena occur, if the element's <a for="forms">checkedness</a> state is true after the occurrence, the <a for="forms">checkedness</a> state of all the other elements in the same <i>radio
  button group</i> must be set to false:

  <ul>

    <li>The element's <a for="forms">checkedness</a> state is set to true (for
    whatever reason).</li>

    <li>The element's <{input/name}> attribute is set, changed, or removed.</li>

    <li>The element's <a>form owner</a> changes.</li>

    <li><a>A type change is signalled</a> for the element.</li>

  </ul>

  If the element <var>R</var> is <a>mutable</a>, then: The
  <a>pre-click activation steps</a> for <var>R</var> consist of getting a reference to the
  element in <var>R</var>'s <a>radio button group</a> that has its <a for="forms">checkedness</a> set to true, if any, and then setting
  <var>R</var>'s <a for="forms">checkedness</a> to true. The <a>canceled
  activation steps</a> for <var>R</var> consist of checking if the element to which a reference
  was obtained in the <a>pre-click activation steps</a>, if any, is still in what is now
  <var>R</var>'s <a>radio button group</a>, if it still has one, and if so, setting that
  element's <a for="forms">checkedness</a> to true; or else, if there was no
  such element, or that element is no longer in <var>R</var>'s <a>radio button group</a>, or
  if <var>R</var> no longer has a <a>radio button group</a>, setting <var>R</var>'s <a for="forms">checkedness</a> to false. The <a>activation behavior</a> for
  <var>R</var> is to <a>fire a simple event</a> that bubbles named <code>input</code> at <var>R</var> and then <a>fire a simple event</a>
  that bubbles named <code>change</code> at <var>R</var>.

  If the element is not <a>mutable</a>, it has no <a>activation
  behavior</a>.

  <strong>Constraint validation</strong>: If an element in the <i>radio button group</i> is <a>required</a>, and all of the <{input}> elements in the
  <i>radio button group</i> have a <a for="forms">checkedness</a> that is
  false, then the element is <a>suffering from being missing</a>.

  <p class="note">
    If none of the radio buttons in a <a>radio button group</a> are checked when
  they are <a for="document">inserted into the document</a>, then they will all be initially unchecked in the interface,
  until such time as one of them is checked (either by the user or by script).

      <dt>[=Allowed ARIA role attribute values=]:</dt>
      <dd>None</dd>
      <dt>[=Allowed ARIA state and property attributes=]:</dt>
      <dd><a>Global aria-* attributes</a></dd>
    </dl>
  </div>

  When an <{input}> element's <{input/type}> attribute is in
  the <{input/File|File Upload}> state, the rules in this section
  apply.

  The <{input}> element <a>represents</a> a list of <dfn>selected files</dfn>, each file
  consisting of a file name, a file type, and a file body (the contents of the file).

  File names must not contain <a>path components</a>, even
  in the case that a user has selected an entire directory hierarchy or multiple files with the same
  name from different directories. <dfn>Path components</dfn>, for
  the purposes of the <{input/File|File Upload}> state, are those parts
  of file names that are separated by U+005C REVERSE SOLIDUS character (\) characters.

  Unless the <code>multiple</code> attribute is set, there must be no more than one file in the
  list of <a>selected files</a>.

  If the element is <a>mutable</a>, then the element's
  <a>activation behavior</a> is to run the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>If the algorithm is not <a>allowed to show a popup</a>, then abort these steps
    without doing anything else.</li>

    <li>Return, but continue running these steps <a>in parallel</a>.</li>

    <li>Optionally, wait until any prior execution of this algorithm has terminated.

    </li><li>Display a prompt to the user requesting that the user specify some files. If the <{input/multiple}> attribute is not set, there must be no more than one
    file selected; otherwise, any number may be selected. Files can be from the filesystem or created
    on the fly, e.g., a picture taken from a camera connected to the user's device.

    </li><li>Wait for the user to have made their selection.</li>

    <li><a>Queue a task</a> to first update the element's <a>selected files</a> so that it represents the user's
    selection, then <a>fire a simple event</a> that bubbles named <code>input</code> at
    the <{input}> element, and finally <a>fire a simple event</a> that bubbles named
    <code>change</code> at the <{input}> element.</li>

  </ol>

  If the element is <a>mutable</a>, the user agent should allow the
  user to change the files on the list in other ways also, e.g., adding or removing files by
  drag-and-drop. When the user does so, the user agent must <a>queue a task</a> to first
  update the element's <a>selected files</a> so that
  it represents the user's new selection, then <a>fire a simple event</a> that bubbles named
  <code>input</code> at the <{input}> element, and finally
  <a>fire a simple event</a> that bubbles named <code>change</code> at the <{input}> element.

  If the element is not <a>mutable</a>, it has no <a>activation
  behavior</a> and the user agent must not allow the user to change the element's selection.

  <strong>Constraint validation</strong>: If the element is <a>required</a> and the list of <a>selected files</a> is empty, then the element is
  <a>suffering from being missing</a>.

  <hr />

  The <dfn element-attr for="input"><code>accept</code></dfn> attribute may be specified to
  provide user agents with a hint of what file types will be accepted.

  If specified, the attribute must consist of a <a>set of comma-separated tokens</a>, each
  of which must be an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for one of the following:

  <dl>

    <dt>The string "<code>audio/*</code>"</dt>

    <dd>Indicates that sound files are accepted.</dd>

    <dt>The string "<code>video/*</code>"</dt>

    <dd>Indicates that video files are accepted.</dd>

    <dt>The string "<code>image/*</code>"</dt>

    <dd>Indicates that image files are accepted.</dd>

    <dt>A <a>valid MIME type with no parameters</a></dt>

    <dd>Indicates that files of the specified type are accepted.</dd>

    <dt>A string whose first character is a U+002E FULL STOP character (.)</dt>

    <dd>Indicates that files with the specified file extension are accepted.</dd>

  </dl>

  The tokens must not be <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> matches for any of the other tokens
  (i.e., duplicates are not allowed). To obtain the list of tokens from the attribute,
  the user agent must <a lt="split a string on commas">split the attribute value on commas</a>.

  User agents may use the value of this attribute to display a more appropriate user interface
  than a generic file picker. For instance, given the value <code>image/*</code>, a user
  agent could offer the user the option of using a local camera or selecting a photograph from their
  photo collection; given the value <code>audio/*</code>, a user agent could offer the user
  the option of recording a clip using a headset microphone.

    User agents should prevent the user from selecting files that are not accepted by one (or more)
    of these tokens.

  <p class="note">
    Authors are encouraged to specify both any MIME types and any corresponding
  extensions when looking for data in a specific format.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    For example, consider an application that converts Microsoft Word documents to Open Document
    Format files. Since Microsoft Word documents are described with a wide variety of MIME types and
    extensions, the site can list several, as follows:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <input type="file" accept=".doc,.docx,.xml,application/msword,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document">
    </xmp>

    On platforms that only use file extensions to describe file types, the extensions listed here
    can be used to filter the allowed documents, while the MIME types can be used with the system's
    type registration table (mapping MIME types to extensions used by the system), if any, to
    determine any other extensions to allow. Similarly, on a system that does not have file names or
    extensions but labels documents with MIME types internally, the MIME types can be used to pick
    the allowed files, while the extensions can be used if the system has an extension registration
    table that maps known extensions to MIME types used by the system.
  </div>

  <p class="warning">Extensions tend to be ambiguous (e.g., there are an untold number of formats
  that use the "<code>.dat</code>" extension, and users can typically quite easily rename
  their files to have a "<code>.doc</code>" extension even if they are not Microsoft Word
  documents), and MIME types tend to be unreliable (e.g., many formats have no formally registered
  types, and many formats are in practice labeled using a number of different MIME types). Authors
  are reminded that, as usual, data received from a client should be treated with caution, as it may
  not be in an expected format even if the user is not hostile and the user agent fully obeyed the
  <{input/accept}> attribute's requirements.</p>

  <div class="example">
    For historical reasons, the {{HTMLInputElement/value}} IDL attribute prefixes
    the file name with the string "<code>C:\fakepath\</code>". Some legacy user agents
    actually included the full path (which was a security vulnerability). As a result of this,
    obtaining the file name from the {{HTMLInputElement/value}} IDL attribute in a
    backwards-compatible way is non-trivial. The following function extracts the file name in a
    suitably compatible manner:

    <pre highlight="javascript">
      function extractFilename(path) {
        if (path.substr(0, 12) == "C:\\fakepath\\")
          return path.substr(12); // modern browser
        var x;
        x = path.lastIndexOf('/');
        if (x &gt;= 0) // Unix-based path
          return path.substr(x+1);
        x = path.lastIndexOf('\\');
        if (x &gt;= 0) // Windows-based path
          return path.substr(x+1);
        return path; // just the file name
      }
    </pre>

    This can be used as follows:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <div>
        <label>
          Choose file:
          <input type="file" name="image" onchange="updateFilename(this.value)">
        </label>
      </div>
      <p>
        The name of the file you picked is: <span id="filename">(none)</span>.
      </p>

      <script>
        function updateFilename(path) {
          var name = extractFilename(path);
          document.getElementById("filename").textContent = name;
        }
      </script>

  The <{input}> element <a>represents</a> a button that, when activated, submits

  <p class="note">
    Since the default label is implementation-defined, and the width of the button
  typically depends on the button's label, the button's width can leak a few bits of fingerprintable
  information. These bits are likely to be strongly correlated to the identity of the user agent and
  the user's locale.

  If the element is <a>mutable</a>, then the element's

  When an <{input}> element's <{input/type}> attribute is in
  the <{input/Image|Image Button}> state, the rules in this section
  apply.

  The <{input}> element <a>represents</a> either an image from which a user can
  select a coordinate and submit the form, or alternatively a button from which the user can submit
  the form. The element is a <a>button</a>, specifically a <{input/Submit|Submit Button}>.

  <p class="note">
    The coordinate is sent to the server <a>during form submission</a> by sending two entries for the element, derived from the name
  of the control but with "<code>.x</code>" and "<code>.y</code>" appended to the
  name with the <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> components of the coordinate
  respectively.
  </p>

  <hr />

  The image is given by the <dfn element-attr for="input"><code>src</code></dfn> attribute. The
  <{input/src}> attribute must be present, and must contain a <a>valid
  non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces</a> referencing a non-interactive, optionally
  animated, image resource that is neither paged nor scripted.

  When any of the these events occur

  <ul>

    <li>the <{input}> element's <{input/type}> attribute is
    first set to the <{input/Image|Image Button}> state (possibly when
    the element is first created), and the <{input/src}> attribute is
    present</li>

    <li>the <{input}> element's <{input/type}> attribute is
    changed back to the <{input/Image|Image Button}> state, and the <{input/src}> attribute is present, and its value has changed since the last
    time the <{input/type}> attribute was in the <{input/Image|Image Button}> state</li>

    <li>the <{input}> element's <{input/type}> attribute is in
    the <{input/Image|Image Button}> state, and the <{input/src}> attribute is set or changed</li>

  </ul>

  then unless the user agent cannot support images, or its support for images has been disabled,
  or the user agent only fetches images on demand, or the <{input/src}>
  attribute's value is the empty string, the user agent must <a>parse</a> the value of the <{input/src}>
  attribute value, relative to the element's <a>node document</a>, and if that is successful, run these substeps:

  <ol>
    <li>Let <var>request</var> be a new <a>request</a> whose
    [=url/URL=] is the <a>resulting URL string</a>,
    <a>client</a> is the element's <a>node document</a>'s
    <code>Window</code> object's <a>environment settings object</a>, <a for="request">type</a> is "<code>image</code>", <a>destination</a> is "<code>subresource</code>",
    <a>omit-<code>Origin</code>-header flag</a> is set, <a>credentials mode</a> is "<code>include</code>", and whose <a>use-URL-credentials flag</a> is set.</li>

    <li><a>Fetch</a> <var>request</var>.</li>
  </ol>

  Fetching the image must <a>delay the load event</a> of the element's <a>node document</a> until the
  <a>task</a> that is <a>queued</a> by the
  <a>networking task source</a> once the resource has been fetched (defined below) has been
  run.

  If the image was successfully obtained, with no network errors, and the image's type is a
  supported image type, and the image is a valid image of that type, then the image is said to be
  <dfn><i>available</i></dfn>. If this is true before the image is
  completely downloaded, each <a>task</a> that is <a>queued</a> by the <a>networking task source</a> while the image is being fetched
  must update the presentation of the image appropriately.

  The user agent should apply the <a>image sniffing
  rules</a> to determine the type of the image, with the image's <a>associated Content-Type headers</a> giving the <var>official
  type</var>. If these rules are not applied, then the type of the image must be the type given by
  the image's <a>associated Content-Type headers</a>.

  User agents must not support non-image resources with the <{input}> element. User
  agents must not run executable code embedded in the image resource. User agents must only display
  the first page of a multipage resource. User agents must not allow the resource to act in an
  interactive fashion, but should honor any animation in the resource.

  The <a>task</a> that is <a>queued</a>
  by the <a>networking task source</a> once the resource has been fetched, must, if the
  download was successful and the image is <i>available</i>,
  <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>load</code> at the <{input}> element; and otherwise, if the fetching
  process fails without a response from the remote server, or completes but the image is not a valid
  or supported image, <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>error</code> on the <{input}> element.

  <hr />

  The <dfn element-attr for="input"><code>alt</code></dfn> attribute provides the textual label for
  the button for users and user agents who cannot use the image. The <{input/alt}> attribute must be present, and must contain a non-empty string
  giving the label that would be appropriate for an equivalent button if the image was
  unavailable.

  The <{input}> element supports <a>dimension attributes</a>.

  <hr />

  If the <{input/src}> attribute is set, and the image is <i>available</i> and the user agent is configured to display that image,
  then: The element <a>represents</a> a control for selecting a <a>coordinate</a> from the image specified by the
  <{input/src}> attribute; if the element is <a>mutable</a>, the user agent should allow the user to select this <a>coordinate</a>, and the element's <a>activation
  behavior</a> is as follows: if the element has a <a>form owner</a>, and the element's
  <a>node document</a> is <a>fully active</a>, take the user's selected <a>coordinate</a>, and <a>submit</a> the <{input}> element's <a>form owner</a>
  from the <{input}> element. If the user activates the control without explicitly
  selecting a coordinate, then the coordinate (0,0) must be assumed.

  Otherwise, the element <a>represents</a> a submit button whose label is given by the
  value of the <{input/alt}> attribute; if the element is <a>mutable</a>, then the element's <a>activation behavior</a> is as
  follows: if the element has a <a>form owner</a>, and the element's <a>node document</a> is
  <a>fully active</a>, set the <a>selected
  coordinate</a> to (0,0), and <a>submit</a> the
  <{input}> element's <a>form owner</a> from the <{input}> element.

  In either case, if the element is <a>mutable</a> but has no
  <a>form owner</a> or the element's <a>node document</a> is not <a>fully active</a>,
  then its <a>activation behavior</a> must be to do nothing. If the element is not <a>mutable</a>, it has no <a>activation behavior</a>.

  The <dfn lt="coordinate|selected coordinate|indicated a coordinate">selected coordinate</dfn> must consist of
  an <var>x</var>-component and a <var>y</var>-component. The coordinates
  represent the position relative to the edge of the image, with the coordinate space having the
  positive <var>x</var> direction to the right, and the positive <var>y</var>
  direction downwards.

  The <var>x</var>-component must be a <a>valid integer</a> representing a number
  <var>x</var> in the range -(<var>border<sub>left</sub></var>+<var>padding<sub>left</sub></var>) ≤ <var>x</var> ≤ <var>width</var>+<var>border<sub>right</sub></var>+<var>padding<sub>right</sub></var>, where <var>width</var> is the rendered width of the image, <var>border<sub>left</sub></var> is the width of the border on the left of the image, <var>padding<sub>left</sub></var> is the width of the padding on the left of the
  image, <var>border<sub>right</sub></var> is the width of the border on the right
  of the image, and <var>padding<sub>right</sub></var> is the width of the padding
  on the right of the image, with all dimensions given in CSS pixels.

  The <var>y</var>-component must be a <a>valid integer</a> representing a number
  <var>y</var> in the range -(<var>border<sub>top</sub></var>+<var>padding<sub>top</sub></var>) ≤ <var>y</var> ≤ <var>height</var>+<var>border<sub>bottom</sub></var>+<var>padding<sub>bottom</sub></var>, where
  <var>height</var> is the rendered height of the image, <var>border<sub>top</sub></var> is the width of the border above the image, <var>padding<sub>top</sub></var> is the width of the padding above the image, <var>border<sub>bottom</sub></var> is the width of the border below the image, and <var>padding<sub>bottom</sub></var> is the width of the padding below the image, with
  all dimensions given in CSS pixels.

  Where a border or padding is missing, its width is zero CSS pixels.

  When an <{input}> element's <{input/type}> attribute is in

  apply.

  The <{input}> element <a>represents</a> a button that, when activated, resets
  the form. If the element has a <{input/value}>
  attribute, the button's label must be the value of that attribute; otherwise, it must be an

  <p class="note">
    Since the default label is implementation-defined, and the width of the button
  typically depends on the button's label, the button's width can leak a few bits of fingerprintable

  the user's locale.

<h5 id="implementation-notes-regarding-localization-of-form-controls"><dfn lt="implementation notes">Implementation notes regarding localization of form controls</dfn></h5>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  The formats shown to the user in date, time, and number controls is independent of the format
  used for <a>form submission</a>.

  Browsers should use user interfaces that present locale-affected formats such as dates, times,
  and numbers according to the conventions of either the locale implied by the <{input}> element's
  <a>language</a> or the user's preferred locale. Using the page's locale will ensure
  consistency with page-provided data.

  <p class="example">For example, it would be confusing to users if an American English page claimed
  that a Cirque De Soleil show was going to be showing on 02/03, but their
  browser, configured to use the British English locale, only showed the date 03/02 in the ticket purchase date picker. Using the page's locale would at least ensure that the
  date was presented in the same format everywhere. (There's still a risk that the user would end up
  arriving a month late, of course, but there's only so much that can be done about such cultural
  differences...)

<h5 id="common-input-element-attributes">Common <{input}> element attributes</h5>

  These attributes only <a>apply</a> to an <{input}>
  element if its <{input/type}> attribute is in a state whose definition

  <a>doesn't apply</a> to an <{input}> element, user agents must
  <a>ignore</a> the attribute, regardless of the requirements and definitions below.

<h6 id="the-maxlength-and-minlength-attributes">The <code>maxlength</code> and <code>minlength</code> attributes</h6>

  The <dfn element-attr for="input"><code>maxlength</code></dfn> attribute, when it <a>applies</a>,
  is a <a>form control <code>maxlength</code> attribute</a>
  controlled by the <{input}> element's <a for="input">dirty value flag</a>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="input"><code>minlength</code></dfn> attribute, when it <a>applies</a>,
  is a <a>form control <code>minlength</code> attribute</a>

  If the <{input}> element has a <a>maximum allowed value length</a>, then the

  the element's <a for="forms">value</a>.

  The <code>size</code> attribute, if specified, must have a value that
  is a <a>valid non-negative integer</a> greater than zero.

  If the attribute is present, then its value must be parsed using the <a>rules for parsing
  non-negative integers</a>, and if the result is a number greater than zero, then the user agent
  should ensure that at least that many characters are visible.

  The <code>size</code> IDL attribute is <a>limited to only
  non-negative numbers greater than zero</a> and has a default value of 20.

<h6 id="the-readonly-attribute">The <code>readonly</code> attribute</h6>

  The <dfn element-attr for="input"><code>readonly</code></dfn> attribute is a <a>boolean
  attribute</a> that controls whether or not the user can edit the form control.
  When specified, the element is not <a>mutable</a>.

  <strong>Constraint validation</strong>: If the <code>readonly</code> attribute is specified
  on an <{input}> element, the element is <a>barred from constraint validation</a>.

  <p class="note">
    The difference between <code>disabled</code> and <code>readonly</code> is that
    read-only controls are still focusable, so the user can still select the text and interact with it,

    For radio buttons, the <code>required</code> attribute is
    satisfied if any of the radio buttons in the <a>group</a> is

    one marked as required:

    To avoid confusion as to whether a <a>radio button group</a> is required or not, authors
    are encouraged to specify the attribute on all the radio buttons in a group. In general,
    authors are encouraged to avoid having radio button groups that do not have any initially
    checked controls in the first place, as this is a state that the user cannot return to,
    and is therefore generally considered a poor user interface.

<h6 id="the-multiple-attribute">The <code>multiple</code> attribute</h6>

  The <dfn element-attr for="input"><code>multiple</code></dfn> attribute is a
  <a>boolean attribute</a> that indicates whether the user is to be allowed to specify more than one
  value.

  <div class="example">
    The following extract shows how an e-mail client's "Cc" field could accept multiple e-mail
    addresses.

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <label>
        Cc:
        <input type="email" multiple name="cc">
      </label>
    </xmp>

    If the user had, amongst many friends in their user contacts database, two friends "Arthur Dent"
    (with address "art@example.net") and "Adam Josh" (with address "adamjosh@example.net"), then,
    after the user has typed "a", the user agent might suggest these two e-mail addresses to the
    user.

    <img src="images/sample-email-1.png" width="500" height="140" alt="Form control group containing 'Send', 'Save now' and 'Discard' buttons, a 'To:' combo box with an 'a' displayed in the text box and 2 list items below.">

    The page could also link in the user's contacts database from the site:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <label>
        Cc:

        <option value="astronomy@science.example.org">
      </datalist>
    </xmp>

    Suppose the user had entered "bob@example.net" into this text field, and then started typing a
    second e-mail address starting with "a". The user agent might show both the two friends mentioned
    earlier, as well as the "astrophy" and "astronomy" values given in the <{datalist}>
    element.

<h6 id="the-pattern-attribute">The <code>pattern</code> attribute</h6>

  The <dfn element-attr for="input"><code>pattern</code></dfn> attribute specifies a regular
  expression against which the control's <a for="forms">value</a>, or, when the
  <code>multiple</code> attribute <a>applies</a> and is set, the control's
  <a for="forms">values</a>, are to be checked.

  If specified, the attribute's value must match the JavaScript <i>Pattern</i>
  production. [[!ECMA-262]]

  If an <{input}> element has a <code>pattern</code>
  attribute specified, and the attribute's value, when compiled as a JavaScript regular expression
  with only the "<code>u</code>" flag specified, compiles successfully, then the resulting regular expression is the element's
  <dfn>compiled pattern regular expression</dfn>. If the element has no such attribute, or if the
  value doesn't compile successfully, then the element has no <a>compiled pattern regular
  expression</a>. [[!ECMA-262]]

  <p class="note">
    If the value doesn't compile successfully, user agents are encouraged to log this fact in a
    developer console, to aid debugging.
  </p>

  <strong>Constraint validation</strong>: If the element's <a for="forms">value</a> is not the empty string, and either the element's <code>multiple</code> attribute is not specified or it <a>does not apply</a> to the <{input}> element given its <{input/type}> attribute's current state, and the element has a
  <a>compiled pattern regular expression</a> but that regular expression does not match the
  entirety of the element's <a for="forms">value</a>, then the element is
  <a>suffering from a pattern mismatch</a>.

  <strong>Constraint validation</strong>: If the element's <a for="forms">value</a> is not the empty string, and the element's <code>multiple</code> attribute is specified and <a>applies</a> to the <{input}> element, and the element has
  a <a>compiled pattern regular expression</a> but that regular expression does not match the
  entirety of each of the element's <a for="forms">values</a>, then the
  element is <a>suffering from a pattern mismatch</a>.

  The <a>compiled pattern regular expression</a>, when matched against a string, must have
  its start anchored to the start of the string and its end anchored to the end of the string.

  <p class="note">
    This implies that the regular expression language used for this attribute is the
  same as that used in JavaScript, except that the <code>pattern</code>
  attribute is matched against the entire value, not just any subset (somewhat as if it implied a
  <code>^(?:</code> at the start of the pattern and a <code>)$</code> at the
  end).
  </p>

  When an <{input}> element has a <code>pattern</code>
  attribute specified, authors should provide a description of the pattern in text near the
  control. Authors may also include a
  <dfn element-attr for="input"><code>title</code></dfn>
  attribute to give a description of the pattern. User agents may use
  the contents of this attribute, if it is present, when informing the
  user that the pattern is not matched, or at any other suitable time,
  such as in a tooltip or read out by assistive technology when the
  control gains focus.

  <p class="warning">Relying on the <{input/title}> attribute for the visual display
  of text content is currently discouraged as many user agents do not expose the attribute in an accessible manner
  as required by this specification (e.g., requiring a pointing device such as a mouse to cause a tooltip to appear,
  which excludes keyboard-only users and touch-only users, such as anyone with a modern phone or
  tablet).</p>

  <div class="example">
    For example, the following snippet:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <label>
        Part number:
        <input pattern="\[0-9]\[A-Z]{3}" name="part" title="A part number is a digit followed by three uppercase letters.">
      </label>
    </xmp>

    ...could cause the user agent to display an alert such as:
    <pre><samp>A part number is a digit followed by three uppercase letters.
You cannot submit this form when the field is incorrect.</samp></pre>
  </div>

  When a control has a <{input/pattern}> attribute, the <{input/title}> attribute, if used, must describe the pattern. Additional
  information could also be included, so long as it assists the user in filling in the control.
  Otherwise, assistive technology would be impaired.

  <p class="example">For instance, if the title attribute contained the caption of the control,
  assistive technology could end up saying something like <samp>The text you have entered does not
  match the required pattern. Birthday</samp>, which is not useful.</p>

  user agents may still show the <{input/title}> in non-error situations (for
  example, as a tooltip when hovering over the control), so authors should be careful not to word
  <{input/title}>s as if an error has necessarily occurred.

<h6 id="the-min-and-max-attributes">The <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> attributes</h6>

  Some form controls can have explicit constraints applied limiting the allowed range of values
  that the user can provide. Normally, such a range would be linear and continuous. A form control
  can <dfn lt="has a periodic domain|have a periodic domain">have a periodic domain</dfn>, however, in which case the
  form control's broadest possible range is finite, and authors can specify explicit ranges within
  it that span the boundaries.

  <p class="example">Specifically, the broadest range of a <code>type="time"</code> control is midnight to midnight (24 hours), and
  authors can set both continuous linear ranges (such as 9pm to 11pm) and discontinuous ranges
  spanning midnight (such as 11pm to 1am).</p>

  The <dfn element-attr for="input"><code>min</code></dfn> and <dfn element-attr for="input"><code>max</code></dfn> attributes indicate the allowed range of values for
  the element.

  Their syntax is defined by the section that defines the <{input/type}> attribute's current state.

  If the element has a <{input/min}> attribute, and the result of
  applying the <a>algorithm to convert a string to a
  number</a> to the value of the <{input/min}> attribute is a number,
  then that number is the element's <dfn for="min">minimum</dfn>; otherwise, if the
  <{input/type}> attribute's current state defines a <dfn>default minimum</dfn>, then that is the <a for="min">minimum</a>; otherwise, the element has no <a for="min">minimum</a>.

  The <{input/min}> attribute also defines the <a>step base</a>.

  If the element has a <{input/max}> attribute, and the result of
  applying the <a>algorithm to convert a string to a
  number</a> to the value of the <{input/max}> attribute is a number,
  then that number is the element's <dfn for="max">maximum</dfn>; otherwise, if the
  <{input/type}> attribute's current state defines a <dfn>default maximum</dfn>, then that is the <a for="max">maximum</a>; otherwise, the element has no <a for="max">maximum</a>.

  If the element does not <a>have a periodic domain</a>, the <{input/max}> attribute's value
  (the <a for="max">maximum</a>) must not be less than the <{input/min}> attribute's value
  (its <a for="min">minimum</a>).

  <p class="note">
    If an element that does not <a>have a periodic
  domain</a> has a <a for="max">maximum</a> that is less than its <a for="min">minimum</a>, then so long as the element has a <a for="forms">value</a>, it will either be <a>suffering from an underflow</a>
  or <a>suffering from an overflow</a>.
  </p>

  An element <dfn lt="have a reversed range|has a reversed range">has a reversed range</dfn> if it <a>has a periodic domain</a> and its
  <a for="max">maximum</a> is less than its <a for="min">minimum</a>.

  An element <dfn lt="have range limitations|has range limitations">has range limitations</dfn> if it has a defined
  <a for="min">minimum</a> or a defined <a for="max">maximum</a>.

  How these range limitations apply depends on whether the element has a <code>multiple</code> attribute.

<h6 id="the-step-attribute">The <code>step</code> attribute</h6>

  The <dfn element-attr for="input"><code>step</code></dfn> attribute indicates the granularity
  that is expected (and required) of the <a for="forms">value</a> or <a for="forms">values</a>,
  by limiting the allowed values. The section that defines the <{input/type}> attribute's current state
  also defines the <dfn>default step</dfn>, the <dfn>step scale factor</dfn>,
  and in some cases the <dfn>default step base</dfn>,
  which are used in processing the attribute as described below.

  The <{input/step}> attribute, if specified, must either have a
  value that is a <a>valid floating-point number</a> that <a lt="parse it as an integer">parses</a>
  to a number that is greater than zero, or must have a
  value that is an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for the string "<code>any</code>".

  The attribute provides the <dfn>allowed value step</dfn> for the
  element, as follows:

  1. If the <{input/step}> attribute is absent, then the <a>allowed value step</a> is the
      <a>default step</a> multiplied by the <a>step scale factor</a>.
  2. Otherwise, if the attribute's value is an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for the string
      "<code>any</code>", then there is no <a>allowed value step</a>.
  3. Otherwise, let <var>step value</var> be the result of running the
      <a>rules for parsing floating-point number values</a>, when they are applied to the
      <{input/step}> attribute's value.
  4. If the previous step returned an error, or <var>step value</var> is zero, or a number less than
      zero, then the <a>allowed value step</a> is the <a>default step</a> multiplied by the
      <a>step scale factor</a>.
  5. If the element's <{input/type}> attribute is in the
      <{input/LocalDateTime|Local Date and Time}>,
      <{input/Date}>,
      <{input/Month}>,
      <{input/Week}>, or
      <{input/Time}> state, then round <var>step value</var> to the nearest
      whole number using the "round to nearest + round half up" technique, unless the value is
      less-than one, in which case let <var>step value</var> be 1.
  6. The <a>allowed value step</a> is <var>step value</var> multiplied by the
      <a>step scale factor</a>.

  The <dfn>step base</dfn> is the value returned by the following algorithm:

  1. If the element has a <{input/min}> content attribute, and the result of applying the
      <a>algorithm to convert a string to a number</a> to the value of the <{input/min}> content
      attribute is not an error, then return that result and abort these steps.
  2. If the element has a <code>value</code> content attribute, and the result of applying the
      <a>algorithm to convert a string to a number</a> to the value of the <{input/value}> content
      attribute is not an error, then return that result and abort these steps.
  3. If a <a>default step base</a> is defined for this element given its <{input/type}> attribute's
      state, then return it and abort these steps.
  4. Return zero.

  How these range limitations apply depends on whether the element has a <code>multiple</code> attribute.

<h6 id="the-list-attribute">The <{input/list}> attribute</h6>

  The <dfn element-attr for="input"><code>list</code></dfn> attribute is used to identify an
  element that lists predefined options suggested to the user.

  If present, its value must be the <a>ID</a> of a <{datalist}>
  element in the same document.

  The <dfn>suggestions source element</dfn> is the first element in
  the document in <a>tree order</a> to have an <a>ID</a> equal to the
  value of the <{input/list}> attribute, if that element is a
  <{datalist}> element. If there is no <{input/list}> attribute,
  or if there is no element with that <a>ID</a>, or if the first element
  with that <a>ID</a> is not a <{datalist}> element, then there is
  no <a>suggestions source element</a>.

  If there is a <a>suggestions source element</a>, then, when
  the user agent is allowing the user to edit the <{input}> element's <a for="forms">value</a>, the user agent should offer the suggestions represented by
  the <a>suggestions source element</a> to the user in a manner
  suitable for the type of control used. The user agent may use the suggestion's <a data-lt='option label'>label</a> to identify the suggestion if appropriate.

  User agents are encouraged to filter the suggestions represented by the <a>suggestions source element</a> when the number of suggestions is
  large, including only the most relevant ones (e.g., based on the user's input so far). No precise
  threshold is defined, but capping the list at four to seven values is reasonable.
  User agents that perform filtering should implement substring matching on the <{option/label}> attribute.

  <p class="warning">Existing user agents filter on either <{option/value}> or <{option/label}> so the behavior may be inconsistent.</p>

  How user selections of suggestions are handled depends on whether the element is a control
  accepting a single value only, or whether it accepts multiple values:

  <dl class="switch">

    <dt>If the element does not have a <code>multiple</code> attribute
    specified or if the <code>multiple</code> attribute <a>does not apply</a></dt>

    <dd>

    When the user selects a suggestion, the <{input}> element's <a for="forms">value</a> must be set to the selected suggestion's <a for="forms">value</a>, as if the user had written that value themself.

    </dd>

    <dt>If the element's <{input/type}> attribute is in the <{input/Range}> state and the element has a <code>multiple</code> attribute specified</dt>

    <dd>

    When the user selects a suggestion, the user agent must identify which value in the element's
    <a for="forms">values</a> the user intended to update, and must then update
    the element's <a for="forms">values</a> so that the relevant value is
    changed to the value given by the selected suggestion's <a for="forms">value</a>, as if the user had themself set it to that value.

    existing entry in the <{input}> element's <a for="forms">values</a> to have the value given by the selected
    suggestion's <a for="forms">value</a>, as if the user had themself added
    an entry with that value, or edited an existing entry to be that value. Which behavior is to be
    applied depends on the user interface in a user-agent-defined manner.

    prevent the values from being rendered in legacy user agents, they need to be placed inside the
    <code>value</code> attribute instead of inline.

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <div>
        <label>
          Enter a breed:
          <input type="text" name="breed" list="breeds">
        </label>
        <datalist id="breeds">
          <option value="Abyssinian">
          <option value="Alpaca">
          <!-- ... -->
        </datalist>
      </div>
    </xmp>

    However, if the values need to be shown in legacy user agents, then fallback content can
    be placed inside the <{datalist}> element, as follows:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <div>
        <label>
          Enter a breed:
          <input type="text" name="breed" list="breeds">
        </label>
        <datalist id="breeds">
          <label>
            or select one from the list:
            <select name="breed">
              <option value="">(none selected)</option>
              <option>Abyssinian</option>
              <option>Alpaca</option>
              <!-- ... -->
            </select>
          </label>
        </datalist>
      </div>
    </xmp>

    The fallback content will only be shown in user agents that don't support <{datalist}>. The
    options, on the other hand, will be detected by all user agents, even though they are not
    children of the <{datalist}> element.

    Note that if an <{option}> element used in a <{datalist}> is <code>selected</code>, it will
    be selected by default by legacy user agents (because it affects the <{select}>), but it
    will not have any effect on the <{input}> element in user agents that support <{datalist}>.

<h6 id="the-placeholder-attribute">The <code>placeholder</code> attribute</h6>

  The <dfn element-attr for="input"><code>placeholder</code></dfn> attribute represents a
  <em>short</em> hint (a word or short phrase) intended to aid the user with data entry when the
  control has no value. A hint could be a sample value or a brief description of the expected
  format. The attribute, if specified, must have a value that contains no U+000A LINE FEED (LF) or
  U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters.

  The <code>placeholder</code> attribute should not be used as a
  replacement for a <{label}>. For a longer hint or other advisory text, place the text
  next to the control.

    <p class="warning">Use of the <code>placeholder</code>
    attribute as a replacement for a <{label}> can reduce the
    accessibility and usability of the control for a range of users including older
    users and users with cognitive, mobility, fine motor skill or vision impairments.
    While the hint given by the control's <{label}> is shown at all times, the short
    hint given in the <code>placeholder</code>
    attribute is only shown before the user enters a value. Furthermore,
    <code>placeholder</code> text may be mistaken for
    a pre-filled value, and as commonly implemented the default color of the placeholder text
    provides insufficient contrast and the lack of a separate visible <{label}>
    reduces the size of the hit region available for setting focus on the control.</p>

  User agents should present this hint to the user, after having <a>stripped line breaks</a> from it,
  when the element's <a for="forms">value</a> is the empty string,
  especially if the control is not <a>focused</a>.

  If a user agent normally doesn't show this hint to the user when the control is
  <a>focused</a>, then the user agent should nonetheless show the hint for the control if it
  was focused as a result of the <{formelements/autofocus}> attribute, since
  in that case the user will not have had an opportunity to examine the control before focusing
  it.

  <div class="example">
    Here is an example of a mail configuration user interface that uses the
    <code>placeholder</code> attribute:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Mail Account</legend>
        <div>
          <label>
            Name:
            <input type="text" name="fullname" placeholder="Johnny Five">
          </label>
        </div>
        <div>
          <label>
            Address:
            <input type="email" name="address" placeholder="john@example.net">
          </label>
        </div>
        <div>
          <label>
            Password:
            <input type="password" name="password">
          </label>
        </div>
        <div>
          <label>
            Description:
            <input type="text" name="desc" placeholder="My Email Account">
          </label>
        </div>
      </fieldset>
    </xmp>

  </div>

  <div class="example">
    In situations where the control's content has one directionality but the placeholder needs to
    have a different directionality, Unicode's bidirectional-algorithm formatting characters can be
    used in the attribute value:

    <pre highlight="html">
&lt;input name="t1" type="tel" placeholder="&amp;#x202B; <bdo dir="rtl">رقم&nbsp;الهاتف&nbsp;1</bdo> &amp;#x202E;"&gt;
&lt;input name="t2" type="tel" placeholder="&amp;#x202B; <bdo dir="rtl">رقم&nbsp;الهاتف&nbsp;2</bdo> &amp;#x202E;"&gt;
    </pre>

    Here's the same example using numeric character references instead of inline Arabic:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <input name="t1" type="tel" placeholder="&#x202B;&#1585;&#1602;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1607;&#1575;&#1578;&#1601; 1&#x202E;">
      <input name="t2" type="tel" placeholder="&#x202B;&#1585;&#1602;&#1605; &#1575;&#1604;&#1607;&#1575;&#1578;&#1601; 2&#x202E;">
    </xmp>

  </div>

<h6 id="the-autocapitalize-attribute">The <code>autocapitalize</code> attribute</h6>

  The <dfn element-attr for="input, textarea"><code>autocapitalize</code></dfn> content attribute is an <a>enumerated attribute</a>. It provides a suggestion to the user agent, to help automatically capitalize text entered by the user in
  <{input}> and <{textarea}> elements. For example when an onscreen keyboard is provided, default word suggestions may be capitalized as described.

  If the user agent sets capitalization automatically, the user must be able to alter the capitalization of the text they enter.

  The value must be one of the following: <code>sentences</code>, <code>words</code>, <code>characters</code> or <code>none</code>.

  The attribute may be omitted. The <i>missing value default</i> is <code>sentences</code> for <{input}> elements in the <{input/Text}> and <{input/Search}> states and <{textarea}> elements, and <code>none</code> for <{input}> elements in the <{input/URL}>, <{input/E-mail}>, and <{input/Password}> states.

  When an <{input}> or a <{textarea}> element has an <{input/autocapitalize}> attribute, text entered by the user should be capitalized as described in the following table:

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Attribute value</th>

  : <dfn mode for="input">value</dfn>
  :: On getting, it must return the current <a for="forms">value</a> of the element. On setting, it
      must set the element's <a for="forms">value</a> to the new value, set the element's
      <a for="input">dirty value flag</a> to true, invoke the <a>value sanitization algorithm</a>,
      if the element's <{input/type}> attribute's current state defines one, and then, if the
      element has a text entry cursor position, should move the text entry cursor position to the
      end of the text field, unselecting any selected text and resetting the selection direction to
      <em>none</em>.

  : <dfn mode for="input">default</dfn>
  :: On getting, if the element has a <{input/value}> attribute, it must return that attribute's
      value; otherwise, it must return the empty string. On setting, it must set the element's
      <{input/value}> attribute to the new value.

  : <dfn mode for="input">default/on</dfn>
  :: On getting, if the element has a <{input/value}> attribute, it must return that attribute's

  The
  <dfn method for="HTMLInputElement"><code>stepDown(<var>n</var>)</code></dfn> and

  methods, when invoked, must run the following algorithm:

  1. If the <code>stepDown()</code> and <code>stepUp()</code> methods <a>do not apply</a>, as
      defined for the <{input}> element's <{input/type}> attribute's current state, then throw an

  2. If the element has no <a>allowed value step</a>, then throw an "{{InvalidStateError}}"
      {{DOMException}}, and abort these steps.
  3. If the element has a <a for="min">minimum</a> and a <a for="max">maximum</a> and the
      <a for="min">minimum</a> is greater than the <a for="max">maximum</a>, then abort these steps.
  4. If the element has a <a for="min">minimum</a> and a <a for="max">maximum</a> and there is no

      <a for="min">minimum</a> and less than or equal to the element's <a for="max">maximum</a>,
      then abort these steps.
  5. If applying the <a>algorithm to convert a string to a number</a> to the string given by the
      element's <a for="forms">value</a> does not result in an error, then let <var>value</var> be
      the result of that algorithm. Otherwise, let <var>value</var> be zero.
  6. Let <var>valueBeforeStepping</var> be <var>value</var>.
  7. If <var>value</var> <a>is not step aligned</a>, then:
      1. If the method invoked was the <code>stepDown()</code> method, then <a>step-align</a>
          <var>value</var> with <var>negative preference</var>. Otherwise <a>step-align</a>
          <var>value</var> with <var>positive preference</var>. In either case, let <var>value</var>

            This ensures that the value first snaps to a <a>step-aligned</a> value when it doesn't
            start step-aligned. For example, starting with the following <{input}> with
            <{input/value}> of 3:

              <input type="number" value="3" min="1" max="10" step="2.6">
            </xmp>
            Invoking the {{HTMLInputElement/stepUp()}} method will snap the <{input/value}> to 3.6;
            subsequent invocations will increment the value by 2.6 (e.g., 6.2, then 8.8). Likewise,
            the following <{input}> element in the <{input/Week}> state will
            also <a>step-align</a> in similar fashion, though in this state, the <{input/step}>
            value is rounded to 3, per the derivation of the <a>allowed value step</a>.

            <xmp highlight="html">

            Invoking {{HTMLInputElement/stepUp()}} will result in a <{input/value}> of
            "<code>2016-W22</code>" because the nearest <a>step-aligned</a> value from the
            <a>step base</a> of "<code>2016-W01</code>" (the <{input/min}> value) with 3 week
            <{input/step}>s that is greater than the <{input/value}> of "<code>2016-W20</code>" is
            "<code>2016-W22</code>" (i.e.: W01, W04, W07, W10, W13, W16, W19, W22).

      4. Let <var>value</var> be the result of adding <var>delta</var> to <var>value</var>.
  8. If the element has a <a for="min">minimum</a>, and <var>value</var> is less than that
      <a for="min">minimum</a>, then set <var>value</var> to the <a>step-aligned</a>
      <a for="min">minimum</a> value with <var>positive preference</var>.
  9. If the element has a <a for="max">maximum</a>, and <var>value</var> is greater than that
      <a for="max">maximum</a>, then set <var>value</var> to the <a>step-aligned</a>
      <a for="max">maximum</a> value with <var>negative preference</var>.
  10. If either the method invoked was the {{HTMLInputElement/stepDown()}} method and

       <a>algorithm to convert a number to a string</a>, as defined for the <{input}> element's
       <{input/type}> attribute's current state, on <var>value</var>.
  12. Set the <a for="forms">value</a> of the element to <var>value as string</var>.

  To determine if a value <var>v</var> <dfn>is step aligned</dfn> do the following:

  <p class="note">This algorithm checks to see if a value falls along an <{input}> element's
  defined <{input/step}> intervals, with the interval's origin at the <a>step base</a> value. It is
  used to determine if the element's <a for="forms">value</a> is
  <a>suffering from a step mismatch</a> and for various checks in the {{HTMLInputElement/stepUp()}}
  and {{HTMLInputElement/stepDown()}} methods.</p>

  1. Subtract the <a>step base</a> from <var>v</var> and let the result be
      <var>relative distance</var>.
  2. If dividing the <var>relative distance</var> by the <a>allowed value step</a> results in a
      value with a remainder then <var>v</var> <dfn>is not step aligned</dfn>. Otherwise it is step
      aligned.

  To <dfn lt="step-align|step-aligned|step-aligns">step-align</dfn> a value <var>v</var> with either
  <var>negative preference</var> or <var>positive preference</var>, do the following:

  <p class="note"><var>negative preference</var> selects a <a>step-aligned</a> value that is less
  than or equal to <var>v</var>, while <var>positive preference</var> <a>step-aligns</a> with a
  value greater than or equal to <var>v</var>.</p>

  1. Subtract the <a>step base</a> from <var>v</var> and let the result be
      <var>relative distance</var>.
  2. Let <var>step interval count</var> be the result of integer dividing (or divide and throw out
      any remainder) <var>relative distance</var> by the <a>allowed value step</a>.
  3. Let <var>candidate</var> be the <var>step interval count</var> multiplied by the
      <a>allowed value step</a>.
  4. If this algorithm was invoked with <var>negative preference</var> and the value of <var>v</var>
      is less than <var>candidate</var>, then decrement <var>candidate</var> by the
      <a>allowed value step</a>.

      Otherwise, if this algorithm was invoked with <var>positive preference</var> and the value of
      <var>v</var> is greater than <var>candidate</var>, then increment <var>candidate</var> by the
      <a>allowed value step</a>.
  5. The <a>step-aligned</a> value is <var>candidate</var>. Return <var>candidate</var>.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLInputElement"><code>list</code></dfn> IDL attribute must return the
  current <a>suggestions source element</a>, if any, or null otherwise.

<h5 id="common-event-behaviors">Common event behaviors</h5>

  When the <code>input</code> and <code>change</code> events <a>apply</a>
  (which is the case for all <{input}> controls other than <a>buttons</a> and those with the <{input/type}> attribute in the <{input/Hidden}> state), the events are fired to indicate that the
  user has interacted with the control. The <dfn event for="input"><code>input</code></dfn>
  event fires whenever the user has modified the data of the control. The <dfn event for="input"><code>change</code></dfn> event fires when the value is committed, if
  that makes sense for the control, or else when the control <a>loses focus</a>. In all cases, the <code>input</code> event comes before the corresponding <code>change</code> event (if any).

  When an <{input}> element has a defined <a>activation behavior</a>, the rules
  for dispatching these events, if they <a>apply</a>, are given
  in the section above that defines the <{input/type}> attribute's
  state. (This is the case for all <{input}> controls with the <{input/type}> attribute in the <{input/Checkbox}> state,
  the <{input/Radio|Radio Button}> state, or the <{input/File|File Upload}> state.)

  For <{input}> elements without a defined <a>activation behavior</a>, but to
  which these events <a>apply</a>, and for which the user
  interface involves both interactive manipulation and an explicit commit action, then when the user
  changes the element's <a for="forms">value</a>, the user agent must
  <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> that bubbles named <code>input</code> at the <{input}> element, and any time the user
  commits the change, the user agent must <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple
  event</a> that bubbles named <code>change</code> at the
  <{input}> element.

  <p class="example">An example of a user interface involving both interactive manipulation and a
  commit action would be a <{input/Range}> controls that use a
  slider, when manipulated using a pointing device. While the user is dragging the control's knob,
  <code>input</code> events would fire whenever the position changed,
  whereas the <code>change</code> event would only fire when the user
  let go of the knob, committing to a specific value.</p>

  For <{input}> elements without a defined <a>activation behavior</a>, but to
  which these events <a>apply</a>, and for which the user
  interface involves an explicit commit action but no intermediate manipulation, then any time the
  user commits a change to the element's <a for="forms">value</a>, the user
  agent must <a>queue a task</a> to first <a>fire a simple event</a> that bubbles named
  <code>input</code> at the <{input}> element, and then
  <a>fire a simple event</a> that bubbles named <code>change</code> at the <{input}> element.

  <p class="example">An example of a user interface with a commit action would be a
  <{input/Color}> control that consists of a single button that brings
  up a color wheel: if the <a for="forms">value</a> only changes when the dialog
  is closed, then that would be the explicit commit action. On the other hand, if manipulating the
  control changes the color interactively, then there might be no commit action.</p>

  <p class="example">Another example of a user interface with a commit action would be a
  <{input/Date}> control that allows both text-based user input and user
  selection from a drop-down calendar: while text input does not have an explicit commit step,
  selecting a date from the drop down calendar and then dismissing the drop down would be a commit
  action.</p>

  <p class="example">The <{input/Range}> control is also an example of a
  user interface that has a commit action when used with a pointing device (rather than a keyboard):
  during the time that the pointing device starts manipulating the slider until the time that the
  slider is released, no commit action is taken (though <code>input</code> events are fired as the
  value is changed). Only after the slider is release is the commit action taken.</p>

  For <{input}> elements without a defined <a>activation behavior</a>, but to
  which these events <a>apply</a>, any time the user causes the
  element's <a for="forms">value</a> to change without an explicit commit
  action, the user agent must <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> that
  bubbles named <code>input</code> at the <{input}> element. The
  corresponding <code>change</code> event, if any, will be fired when
  the control <a>loses focus</a>.

  <p class="example">Examples of a user changing the element's <a for="forms">value</a> would include the user typing into a text field, pasting a
  new value into the field, or undoing an edit in that field. Some user interactions do not cause
  changes to the value, e.g., hitting the "delete" key in an empty text field, or replacing some text
  in the field with text from the clipboard that happens to be exactly the same text.</p>

  <p class="example">A <{input/Range}> control in the form of a
  slider that the user has <a>focused</a> and is interacting with using a keyboard would be
  another example of the user changing the element's <a for="forms">value</a>
  without a commit step.</p>

  In the case of <a>tasks</a> that just fire an <code>input</code> event, user agents may wait for a suitable break in the
  user's interaction before <a>queuing</a> the tasks; for example, a
  user agent could wait for the user to have not hit a key for 100ms, so as to only fire the event
  when the user pauses, instead of continuously for each keystroke.

  When the user agent is to change an <{input}> element's <a for="forms">value</a> on behalf of the user (e.g., as part of a form prefilling
  feature), the user agent must <a>queue a task</a> to first update the <a for="forms">value</a> accordingly, then <a>fire a simple event</a> that
  bubbles named <code>input</code> at the <{input}> element,
  then <a>fire a simple event</a> that bubbles named <code>change</code> at the <{input}> element.

  <p class="note">
    These events are not fired in response to changes made to the values of form
  controls by scripts. (This is to make it easier to update the values of form controls in response
  to the user manipulating the controls, without having to then filter out the script's own changes
  to avoid an infinite loop.)
  </p>

  The <a>task source</a> for these <a>tasks</a> is the
  <a>user interaction task source</a>.

  The <{button}> element <a>represents</a> a control allowing a user to trigger actions,
  when enabled. It is labeled by its content.

  The element is a <a>button</a>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="button"><code>type</code></dfn> attribute controls the behavior of
  the button when it is activated. It is an <a>enumerated attribute</a>. The following table
  lists the allowed keywords for the attribute that will determine the state of the element —
  the keywords in the left column map to the states in the cell in the second column on the
  same row as the keyword.

  <table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th> Keyword </th>
      <th> State </th>
      <th> Brief description </th>
    </tr>

  The <i>missing value default</i> is the <a element-state for="button/type">submit button</a> state.

  If the <{button/type}> attribute is in the <a element-state for="button/type">submit button</a>
  state, the element is specifically a <a element-state for="button/type">submit button</a>.

  <strong>Constraint validation</strong>: If the <{button/type}> attribute is in the
  <a element-state for="button/type">reset button</a> state, or the
  <a element-state for="button/type">Button</a> state, the element is barred
  from constrain validation.

  When a <{button}> element is not disabled, its <a>activation behavior</a>
  is to run the steps defined in the following list for the current state of the
  element's <{button/type}> attribute:

  <dl>

    <dt> <a element-state for="button/type">submit button</a> </dt>

    <dd>If the element has a <a>form owner</a> and the element's <a>node document</a> is
    <a>fully active</a>, the element must <a>submit</a> the
    <a>form owner</a> from the <{button}> element.</dd>

    <dt> <a element-state for="button/type">reset button</a> </dt>

    <dd>If the element has a <a>form owner</a> and the element's <a>node document</a> is
    <a>fully active</a>, the element must <a>reset</a> the <a>form owner</a>.</dd>

    <dt> <a element-state for="button/type">Button</a>

    </dt><dd>Do nothing.</dd>

  </dl>

  The <{button/form}> attribute is used to explicitly associate the
  <{button}> element with its <a>form owner</a>. The <{button/name}> attribute represents the element's name. The <{button/disabled}> attribute is used to make the control non-interactive and
  to prevent its value from being submitted. The <{button/autofocus}>
  attribute controls focus. The <{button/formaction}>, <{button/formenctype}>, <{button/formmethod}>, <{button/formnovalidate}>, and <{button/formtarget}> attributes are <a>attributes for form submission</a>.

  <p class="note">
    The <{button/formnovalidate}> attribute can be
  used to make submit buttons that do not trigger the constraint validation.
  </p>

  The <{button/formaction}>, <{button/formenctype}>, <{button/formmethod}>, <{button/formnovalidate}>, and <{button/formtarget}> must not be specified if the element's <{input/type}> attribute is not in the <a element-state for="button/type">submit button</a> state.

  The <dfn element-attr for="button"><code>value</code></dfn> attribute gives the element's value
  for the purposes of <a>form submission</a>. The element's <a for="forms">value</a> is
  the value of the element's <{button/value}> attribute, if there is
  one, or the empty string otherwise.

  <p class="note">
    A button (and its value) is only included in the <a>form submission</a> if the button
  itself was used to initiate the <a>form submission</a>.

  The <{select}> element represents a control for selecting amongst a set of
  options.

  The <dfn element-attr for="select"><code>multiple</code></dfn> attribute is a <a>boolean
  attribute</a>. If the attribute is present, then the <{select}> element
  <a>represents</a> a control for selecting zero or more options from the <a>list of options</a>. If the attribute is absent, then the
  <{select}> element <a>represents</a> a control for selecting a single option from
  the <a>list of options</a>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="select"><code>size</code></dfn> attribute gives the number of options
  to show to the user. The <code>size</code> attribute, if specified, must
  have a value that is a <a>valid non-negative integer</a> greater than zero.

  The <dfn>display size</dfn> of a <{select}> element is the
  result of applying the <a>rules for parsing non-negative integers</a> to the value of
  element's <code>size</code> attribute, if it has one and parsing it is
  successful. If applying those rules to the attribute's value is not successful,
  or if the <code>size</code> attribute is absent,
  then the element's <a>display size</a> is 4 if the element's <code>multiple</code> content attribute is present, and 1 otherwise.

  The <dfn>list of options</dfn> for a <{select}>
  element consists of all the <{option}> element children of the <{select}>
  element, and all the <{option}> element children of all the <{optgroup}> element
  children of the <{select}> element, in <a>tree order</a>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="select"><code>required</code></dfn> attribute is a <a>boolean
  attribute</a>. When specified, the user will be required to select a value before submitting
  the form.

  If a <{select}> element has a <code>required</code>
  attribute specified, does not have a <code>multiple</code> attribute
  specified, and has a <a>display size</a> of 1; and if the <a for="forms">value</a> of the first <{option}> element in the
  <{select}> element's <a>list of options</a> (if
  any) is the empty string, and that <{option}> element's parent node is the
  <{select}> element (and not an <{optgroup}> element), then that
  <{option}> is the <{select}> element's <dfn>placeholder label option</dfn>.

  If a <{select}> element has a <code>required</code>
  attribute specified, does not have a <code>multiple</code> attribute
  specified, and has a <a>display size</a> of 1, then the
  <{select}> element must have a <a>placeholder label option</a>.

  <p class="note">
    In practice, the requirement stated in the paragraph above can only apply when a
  <{select}> element does not have a <code>sizes</code> attribute
  with a value greater than 1.
  </p>

  <strong>Constraint validation</strong>: If the element has its <code>required</code> attribute specified, and either none of the
  <{option}> elements in the <{select}> element's <a>list of options</a> have their <a state for="option">selectedness</a> set to true, or the only
  <{option}> element in the <{select}> element's <a>list of options</a> with its
  <a state for="option">selectedness</a> set to true is the <a>placeholder label option</a>,
  then the element is <a>suffering from being missing</a>.

  If the <code>multiple</code> attribute is absent, and the element
  is not disabled, then the user agent should allow the
  user to pick an <{option}> element in its <a>list
  of options</a> that is itself not disabled. Upon
  this <{option}> element being <dfn>picked</dfn> (whether
  through a click, or using the keyboard, or any other mechanism), and before the
  relevant user interaction event  is queued (e.g., before the
  <code>click</code> event), the user agent must set the <a state for="option">selectedness</a> of the picked <{option}> element
  to true, set its <a state for="option">dirtiness</a> to true, and then
  <a>send <code>select</code> update notifications</a>.

  If the <code>multiple</code> attribute is absent, whenever an
  <{option}> element in the <{select}> element's <a>list of options</a> has its <a state for="option">selectedness</a> set to true, and whenever an
  <{option}> element with its <a state for="option">selectedness</a> set to true is added to the
  <{select}> element's <a>list of options</a>,
  the user agent must set the <a state for="option">selectedness</a> of all
  the other <{option}> elements in its <a>list of
  options</a> to false.

  If the <code>multiple</code> attribute is absent and the
  element's <a>display size</a> is greater than 1, then the user
  agent should also allow the user to request that the <{option}> whose <a state for="option">selectedness</a> is true, if any, be unselected. Upon this
  request being conveyed to the user agent, and before the relevant user interaction event  is queued (e.g., before the <code>click</code> event), the user agent must set the <a state for="option">selectedness</a> of that <{option}> element to
  false, set its <a state for="option">dirtiness</a> to true, and then
  <a>send <code>select</code> update notifications</a>.

  If <a lt="insert">nodes are inserted</a> or <a lt="remove">nodes are removed</a> causing the <a>list of options</a> to gain or lose one or more
  <{option}> elements, or if an <{option}> element in the <a>list of options</a> <dfn lt="ask for a reset|asks for a reset">asks for a reset</dfn>, then, if the <{select}> element's <code>multiple</code> attribute is absent, the user agent must run the
  first applicable set of steps from the following list:

  <dl class="switch">

    <dt>If the <{select}>
    element's <a>display size</a> is 1, and no <{option}>
    elements in the <{select}> element's <a>list of
    options</a> have their <a state for="option">selectedness</a> set to
    true</dt>

    <dd>Set the <a state for="option">selectedness</a> of the first
    <{option}> element in the <a>list of
    options</a> in <a>tree order</a> that is not disabled, if any, to true.</dd>

    <dt>If two or more <{option}> elements in the <{select}> element's <a>list of options</a> have their <a state for="option">selectedness</a> set to true</dt>

    <dd>Set the <a state for="option">selectedness</a> of all but the last
    <{option}> element with its <a state for="option">selectedness</a> set to true in the <a>list of options</a> in <a>tree order</a> to
    false.</dd>

  </dl>

  If the <code>multiple</code> attribute is present, and the
  element is not disabled, then the user agent should
  allow the user to <dfn>toggle</dfn> the <a state for="option">selectedness</a> of the <{option}> elements in
  its <a>list of options</a> that are themselves not disabled. Upon such an element being <a>toggled</a>
  (either through a click, or any other mechanism), and before the
  relevant user interaction event  is queued (e.g., before a related <code>click</code> event),
  the <a state for="option">selectedness</a> of the <{option}> element must
  be changed (from true to false or false to true), the <a state for="option">dirtiness</a>
  of the element must be set to true, and the
  user agent must <a>send <code>select</code> update notifications</a>.

  When the user agent is to <dfn>send <code>select</code> update notifications</dfn>,
  <a>queue a task</a> to first <a>fire a simple event</a> that bubbles named <code>input</code> at the
  <{select}> element, and then <a>fire a simple event</a> that bubbles named <code>change</code> at the
  <{select}> element, using the <a>user interaction task source</a> as the task
  source. If the <a>JavaScript execution context stack</a> was not empty when the user agent was
  to <a>send <code>select</code> update notifications</a>, then the resulting <code>input</code> and <code>change</code> events must not be
  <a>trusted</a>.

  The <a>reset algorithm</a> for <{select}>
  elements is to go through all the <{option}> elements in the element's <a>list of options</a>, set their <a state for="option">selectedness</a> to true if the <{option}>
  element has a <code>selected</code> attribute, and false otherwise,
  set their <a state for="option">dirtiness</a> to false, and then have the
  <{option}> elements <a>ask for a reset</a>.

  The <{select/form}> attribute is used to explicitly associate the <{select}> element with its <a>form owner</a>.
  The <{select/name}> attribute represents the element's name.
  The <{select/disabled}> attribute is used to make the control non-interactive and to prevent its value from being submitted.
  The <{select/autofocus}> attribute controls focus.
  The <{select/autocomplete}> attribute controls how the user agent provides autofill behavior.

  A <{select}> element that is not disabled is
  <a>mutable</a>.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLSelectElement"><code>type</code></dfn> IDL attribute, on getting, must
  return the string "<code>select-one</code>" if the <code>multiple</code> attribute is absent, and the string "<code>select-multiple</code>" if the <code>multiple</code>
  attribute is present.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLSelectElement"><code>options</code></dfn> IDL attribute must return an
  <code>HTMLOptionsCollection</code> rooted at the <code>select</code> node, whose filter matches
  the elements in the <a>list of options</a>.

  The <code>options</code> collection is also mirrored on the
  <code>HTMLSelectElement</code> object. The <a>supported property indices</a> at any instant
  are the indices supported by the object returned by the <code>options</code> attribute at that instant.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLSelectElement"><code>length</code></dfn> IDL attribute must return the
  number of nodes <a>represented</a> by the <code>options</code> collection. On setting, it must act like the attribute
  of the same name on the <code>options</code> collection.

  The <dfn method for="HTMLSelectElement"><code>item(<var>index</var>)</code></dfn> method

  Similarly, the <dfn method for="HTMLSelectElement" title="add(element, before)">add(element, before)</dfn> method must act like its

  On setting, the <code>selectedIndex</code> attribute must set
  the <a state for="option">selectedness</a> of all the <{option}>

  then the <{option}> element in the <a>list of

  any, must have its <a state for="option">selectedness</a> set to true and
  its <a state for="option">dirtiness</a> set to true.

  <p class="note">
    This can result in no element having a <a state for="option">selectedness</a> set to true even in the case of the
  <{select}> element having no <code>multiple</code>
  attribute and a <a>display size</a> of 1.
  </p>

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLSelectElement"><code>value</code></dfn> IDL attribute, on getting, must

  attribute has a default value of zero.

  <p class="note">
    For historical reasons, the default value of the <code>size</code> IDL attribute does not return the actual size used, which, in

  <div class="example">
    The following example shows how a <{select}> element can be used to offer the user
    with a set of options from which the user can select a single option. The default option is
    preselected.

          <option value="5">Firebot</option>
        </select>

    When there is no default option, a value that provides instructions or a hint

  The <{datalist}> element represents a set of <{option}> elements that
  represent predefined options for other controls. In the rendering, the <{datalist}>
  element <a>represents</a> nothing and it, along with its children, should be hidden.

  The <{datalist}> element can be used in two ways. In the simplest case, the
  <{datalist}> element has just <{option}> element children.

  <div class="example">
    <xmp highlight="html">
      <label>
        Favorite Muppet:
        <input name="muppet" list="muppets">

          <option value="Miss Piggy">
        </datalist>
      </label>
    </xmp>

  </div>

  In the more elaborate case, the <{datalist}> element can be given contents that are to
  be displayed for down-level clients that don't support <{datalist}>. In this case, the
  <{option}> elements are provided inside a <{select}> element inside the
  <{datalist}> element.

  <div class="example">
    <xmp highlight="html">
      <label>
        Favourite Muppet:
        <input name="muppet" list="muppets">

      <datalist id="muppets">
        <label>
          or select from the list:
          <select name="muppet">

          </select>
        </label>
      </datalist>
    </xmp>

  </div>

  The <{datalist}> element is hooked up to an <{input}> element using the <{input/list}> attribute on the <{input}> element.

  Each <{option}> element that is a descendant of the <{datalist}> element,
  that is not disabled, and whose <a for="forms">value</a> is a string that isn't the empty string,
  represents a suggestion. Each suggestion has a <a for="forms">value</a> and a
  <a data-lt='option label'>label</a>.

  <dl class="domintro">

  The <{optgroup}> element <a>represents</a> a group of <{option}>
  elements with a common label.

  The element's group of <{option}> elements consists of the <{option}>
  elements that are children of the <{optgroup}> element.

  When showing <{option}> elements in <{select}> elements, user agents should
  show the <{option}> elements of such groups as being related to each other and separate
  from other <{option}> elements.

  The <dfn element-attr for="optgroup"><code>disabled</code></dfn> content attribute is a
  <a>boolean attribute</a> and can be used to <a lt="actually disabled">disable</a> a group of <{option}> elements
  together.

  The <dfn element-attr for="optgroup"><code>label</code></dfn> content attribute must be specified. Its
  value gives the name of the group, for the purposes of the user interface.
  User agents should use this attribute's value when labeling the group of <{option}> elements
  in a <{select}> element.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLOptGroupElement"><code>disabled</code></dfn> and <dfn attribute for="HTMLOptGroupElement"><code>label</code></dfn> IDL attributes must <a>reflect</a> the
  respective content attributes of the same name.

  <p class="note">
    There is no way to select an <{optgroup}> element. Only
  <{option}> elements can be selected. An <{optgroup}> element merely provides a
  label for a group of <{option}> elements.

  The <{option}> element <a>represents</a> an option in a <{select}> element or as part of a list of
  suggestions in a <{datalist}> element.

  In certain circumstances described in the definition of the <{select}> element, an <{option}>
  element can be a <{select}> element's <a>placeholder label option</a>. A
  <a>placeholder label option</a> does not represent an actual option, but instead represents a
  label for the <{select}> control.

  The <dfn element-attr for="option"><code>disabled</code></dfn> content attribute is a
  <a>boolean attribute</a>. An <{option}> element is disabled if its <{option/disabled}> attribute
  is present or if it is a child of an <{optgroup}> element whose <{optgroup/disabled}> attribute is
  present.

  An <{option}> element that is disabled must prevent any <a event><code>click</code></a> events
  that are <a>queued</a> on the <a>user interaction task source</a> from being dispatched on the
  element.

  The <dfn element-attr for="option"><code>label</code></dfn> content attribute provides a label for
  the element. The <dfn lt='option label'>label</dfn> of an <{option}> element is the value of the <{option/label}>
  content attribute, if there is one and its value is not the empty string, or, otherwise, the value
  of the element's {{HTMLOptionElement/text}} IDL attribute if its value is not the empty string.

  The <{option/label}> content attribute, if specified, must not be empty.

  The <dfn element-attr for="option"><code>value</code></dfn> content attribute provides a value for
  element. The <i>value</i> of an <{option}> element is the value of the <code>value</code> content
  attribute, if there is one, or, if there is not, the value of the element's
  {{HTMLOptionElement/text}} IDL attribute (which may be the empty string).

  The <dfn element-attr for="option"><code>selected</code></dfn> content attribute is a
  <a>boolean attribute</a>. It represents the default <a state for="option">selectedness</a> of the
  element.

  The <dfn state for="option">dirtiness</dfn> of an <{option}> element is a boolean state, initially
  false. It controls whether adding or removing the <{option/selected}> content attribute has any
  effect.

  The <dfn state for="option">selectedness</dfn> of an <{option}> element is a boolean state,
  initially false. Except where otherwise specified, when the element is created, its
  <a state for="option">selectedness</a> must be set to true if the element has a
  <{option/selected}> attribute. Whenever an <{option}> element's <{option/selected}> attribute is
  added, if its <a state for="option">dirtiness</a> is false, its
  <a state for="option">selectedness</a> must be set to true. Whenever an <{option}> element's
  <{option/selected}> attribute is <em>removed</em>, if its <a state for="option">dirtiness</a> is
  false, its <a state for="option">selectedness</a> must be set to false.

  <p class="note">The <a constructor for="HTMLOptionElement"><code>Option()</code></a> constructor,
  when called with three or fewer arguments, overrides the initial state of the
  <a state for="option">selectedness</a> state to always be false even if the third argument is true
  (implying that a <{option/selected}> attribute is to be set). The fourth argument can be used to
  explicitly set the initial <a state for="option">selectedness</a> state when using the
  constructor.</p>

  A <{select}> element whose <{select/multiple}> attribute is not specified must not have more than
  one descendant <{option}> element with its <{option/selected}> attribute set.

  An <{option}> element's <dfn for="option">index</dfn> is the number of <{option}> elements that are
  in the same <a>list of options</a> but that come before it in <a>tree order</a>. If the <{option}>
  element is not in a <a>list of options</a>, then the <{option}> element's
  {{HTMLOptionElement/index}} is zero.

  <dl class="domintro">
    <dt><var>option</var> . {{HTMLOptionElement/selected}}</dt>
    <dd>Returns true if the element is selected, and false otherwise.

    Can be set, to override the current state of the element.</dd>

    <dt><var>option</var> . {{HTMLOptionElement/index}}</dt>
    <dd>Returns the index of the element in its <{select}> element's {{HTMLSelectElement/options}}
    list.</dd>

    <dt><var>option</var> . {{HTMLOptionElement/form}}</dt>
    <dd>Returns the element's <{form}> element, if any, or null otherwise.</dd>

    <dt><var>option</var> . {{HTMLOptionElement/text}}</dt>
    <dd>Same as {{Node/textContent}}, except that spaces are collapsed and <{script}> elements are
    skipped.</dd>

    <dt><var>option</var> = new {{Option()}}( [ <var>text</var> [, <var>value</var> [, <var>defaultSelected</var> [, <var>selected</var> ] ] ] ] )</dt>
    <dd>Returns a new <{option}> element.

    The <var>text</var> argument sets the contents of the element.

    The <var>value</var> argument sets the <{option/value}> attribute.

    The <var>defaultSelected</var> argument sets the <{option/selected}> attribute.

    The <var>selected</var> argument sets whether or not the element is selected. If it is omitted,
    even if the <var>defaultSelected</var> argument is true, the element is not selected.</dd>
  </dl>

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLOptionElement"><code>disabled</code></dfn> IDL attribute must
  <a>reflect</a> the content attribute of the same name. The
  <dfn attribute for="HTMLOptionElement"><code>defaultSelected</code></dfn> IDL attribute must
  <a>reflect</a> the <{option/selected}> content attribute.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLOptionElement"><code>label</code></dfn> IDL attribute, on getting, if
  there is a <{option/label}> content attribute, must return that attribute's value; otherwise, it
  must return the element's <a data-lt='option label'>label</a>. On setting, the element's <{option/label}> content
  attribute must be set to the new value.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLOptionElement"><code>value</code></dfn> IDL attribute, on getting,
  must return the element's <a for="forms">value</a>. On setting, the element's <{option/value}>
  content attribute must be set to the new value.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLOptionElement"><code>selected</code></dfn> IDL attribute, on getting,
  must return true if the element's <a state for="option">selectedness</a> is true, and false
  otherwise. On setting, it must set the element's <a state for="option">selectedness</a> to the new
  value, set its <a state for="option">dirtiness</a> to true, and then cause the element to
  <a>ask for a reset</a>.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLOptionElement"><code>index</code></dfn> IDL attribute must return the
  element's <a>index</a>.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLOptionElement"><code>text</code></dfn> IDL attribute, on getting, must
  return the result of <a>stripping and collapsing white space</a> from the <a>child text content</a>
  of the <{option}> element, in <a>tree order</a>,
  excluding any that are descendants of descendants of the <{option}> element that are themselves
  <{script}> elements in the <a>HTML namespace</a> or <{script}> elements in the
  <a>SVG namespace</a>.

  On setting, the {{HTMLOptionElement/text}} attribute must act as if the {{Node/textContent}} IDL
  attribute on the element had been set to the new value.

  The {{HTMLOptionElement/form}} IDL attribute's behavior depends on whether the <{option}> element
  is in a <{select}> element or not. If the <{option}> has a <{select}> element as its parent, or
  has an <{optgroup}> element as its parent and that <{optgroup}> element has a <{select}> element
  as its parent, then the {{HTMLOptionElement/form}} IDL attribute must return the same value as the
  {{HTMLSelectElement/form}} IDL attribute on that <{select}> element. Otherwise, it must return
  null.

  A constructor is provided for creating {{HTMLOptionElement}} objects (in addition to the factory
  methods from DOM such as {{Document/createElement()}}):
  <dfn constructor for="HTMLOptionElement"><code>Option(<var>text</var>, <var>value</var>, <var>defaultSelected</var>, <var>selected</var>)</code></dfn>.
  When invoked as a constructor, it must return a new {{HTMLOptionElement}} object (a new <{option}>
  element). If the first argument is not the empty string, the new object must have as its only
  child a {{Text}} node whose data is the value of that argument. Otherwise, it must have no
  children. If the <var>value</var> argument is present, the new object must have a
  <code>value</code> attribute set with the value of the argument as its value. If the
  <var>defaultSelected</var> argument is true, the new object must have a <{option/selected}>
  attribute set with no value. If the <var>selected</var> argument is true, the new object must have
  its <a state for="option">selectedness</a> set to true; otherwise the
  <a state for="option">selectedness</a> must be set to false, even if the
  <var>defaultSelected</var> argument is true. The element's <a>node document</a> must be the
  <a>active document</a> of the <a>browsing context</a> of the {{Window}} object on which the
  interface object of the invoked constructor is found.

  The <{textarea}> element <a>represents</a> a multiline plain text edit
  control for the element's <dfn>raw value</dfn>.
  The contents of the control represent the control's default value.

  The <a>raw value</a> of a <{textarea}>
  control must be initially the empty string.

  <p class="note">
    This element <a href="#bidireq">has rendering requirements involving the bidirectional algorithm</a>.
  </p>

  The <dfn element-attr for="textarea"><code>readonly</code></dfn> attribute is a
  <a>boolean attribute</a> used to control whether the text can be edited by the user or not.

  <div class="example">
    In this example, a text field is marked read-only because it represents a read-only file:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <label for="buffer">
        Filename: <code>/etc/bash.bashrc</code>
      </label>
      <textarea id="buffer" name="buffer" readonly>
      # System-wide .bashrc file for interactive bash(1) shells.

      # To enable the settings / commands in this file for login shells as well,
      # this file has to be sourced in /etc/profile.

      # If not running interactively, don't do anything
      [ -z "$PS1" ] &amp;&amp; return

      ...</textarea>
    </xmp>

  </div>

  <strong>Constraint validation</strong>: If the <{textarea/readonly}> attribute is specified on a <{textarea}>
  element, the element is <a>barred from constraint validation</a>.

  A <{textarea}> element is <a>mutable</a> if it is
  neither disabled nor has a <{textarea/readonly}> attribute specified.

  When a <{textarea}> is <a>mutable</a>, its <a>raw value</a> should be editable by the user: the user agent
  should allow the user to edit, insert, and remove text, and to insert and remove line breaks in
  the form of U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters. Any time the user causes the element's <a>raw value</a> to change, the user agent must <a>queue a
  task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> that bubbles named <code>input</code> at the <{textarea}> element. User agents may wait for a
  suitable break in the user's interaction before queuing the task; for example, a user agent could
  wait for the user to have not hit a key for 100ms, so as to only fire the event when the user
  pauses, instead of continuously for each keystroke.

  A <{textarea}> element has a <dfn for="textarea">dirty value flag</dfn>, which must be initially
  set to false, and must be set to true whenever the user interacts with the control in a way that
  changes the <a>raw value</a>.

  When the <{textarea}> element's {{Node/textContent}} IDL attribute changes value,
  if the element's <a for="textarea">dirty value flag</a> is false, then the
  element's <a>raw value</a> must be set to the value of
  the element's {{Node/textContent}} IDL attribute.

  The <a>reset algorithm</a> for <{textarea}> elements is to set the
  <a for="textarea">dirty value flag</a> back to false, and set the element's <a>raw value</a> to
  the value of the element's {{Node/textContent}} IDL attribute.

  When a <{textarea}> element is popped off the <a>stack of open elements</a> of
  an <a>HTML parser</a> or <a>XML parser</a>, then the user agent must invoke the
  element's <a>reset algorithm</a>.

  If the element is <a>mutable</a>, the user agent should allow
  the user to change the writing direction of the element, setting it either to a left-to-right
  writing direction or a right-to-left writing direction. If the user does so, the user agent must
  then run the following steps:

  1. Set the element's <{global/dir}> attribute to
      "<a attr-value for="global/dir"><code>ltr</code></a>" if the user selected a left-to-right
      writing direction, and "<a attr-value for="global/dir"><code>rtl</code></a>" if the user
      selected a right-to-left writing direction.
  2. <a>Queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> that bubbles named <code>input</code> at the
      <{textarea}> element.

  The <dfn element-attr for="textarea"><code>cols</code></dfn> attribute specifies the expected
  maximum number of characters per line. If the <code>cols</code>
  attribute is specified, its value must be a <a>valid non-negative integer</a> greater than
  zero. If applying the <a>rules for parsing non-negative integers</a> to the attribute's value
  results in a number greater than zero, then the element's <dfn>character width</dfn> is that value;
  otherwise, it is 20.

  The user agent may use the <{textarea}> element's <a>character width</a> as a hint to the user as to how many
  characters the server prefers per line (e.g., for visual user agents by making the width of the
  control be that many characters). In visual renderings, the user agent should wrap the user's
  input in the rendering so that each line is no wider than this number of characters.

  The <dfn element-attr for="textarea"><code>rows</code></dfn> attribute specifies the number of
  lines to show. If the <code>rows</code> attribute is specified, its
  value must be a <a>valid non-negative integer</a> greater than zero.
  If applying the <a>rules for parsing non-negative integers</a> to the attribute's value
  results in a number greater than zero, then the element's <dfn>character
  height</dfn> is that value; otherwise, it is 2.

  Visual user agents should set the height of the control to the number of lines given by
  <a>character height</a>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="textarea"><code>wrap</code></dfn> attribute is an <a>enumerated
  attribute</a> with two keywords and states: the <dfn attr-value for="textarea/wrap"><code>soft</code></dfn> keyword which maps to the <a state for="textarea">Soft</a> state, and the <dfn attr-value for="textarea/wrap"><code>hard</code></dfn> keyword which maps to the <a state for="textarea">Hard</a> state. The <i>missing value default</i> is the
  <a state for="textarea">Soft</a> state.

  The <dfn state for="textarea">Soft</dfn> state indicates that the text in the
  <{textarea}> is not to be wrapped when it is submitted (though it can still be wrapped in
  the rendering).

  The <dfn state for="textarea">Hard</dfn> state indicates that the text in the
  <{textarea}> is to have newlines added by the user agent so that the text is wrapped when
  it is submitted.

  If the element's <code>wrap</code> attribute is in the <a state for="textarea">Hard</a> state, the <code>cols</code> attribute must be specified.

  For historical reasons, the element's value is normalized in three different ways for three
  different purposes. The <a>raw value</a> is the value as
  it was originally set. It is not normalized. The <a>API
  value</a> is the value used in the <code>value</code> IDL
  attribute. It is normalized so that line breaks use U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters. Finally,
  there is the <a for="forms">value</a>, as used in <a>form submission</a> and other
  processing models in this specification. It is normalized so that line breaks use U+000D CARRIAGE
  RETURN U+000A LINE FEED (CRLF) character pairs, and in addition, if necessary given the element's
  <code>wrap</code> attribute, additional line breaks are inserted to
  wrap the text at the given width.

  The element's <dfn>API value</dfn> is defined to be the
  element's <a>raw value</a> with the following
  transformation applied:

  <ol>

    <li>Replace every U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED (CRLF) character pair from the <a>raw value</a> with a single U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
    character.</li>

    <li>Replace every remaining U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN character from the <a>raw value</a> with a single U+000A LINE FEED (LF)
    character.</li>

  </ol>

  The element's <a for="forms">value</a> is defined to be the element's <a>raw value</a> with the <a>textarea wrapping
  transformation</a> applied. The <dfn>textarea wrapping transformation</dfn> is the following
  algorithm, as applied to a string:

  <ol>

    <li>Replace every occurrence of a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) character not followed by a
    U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character, and every occurrence of a U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character not
    preceded by a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) character, by a two-character string consisting of a
    U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED (CRLF) character pair.</li>

    <li>If the element's <code>wrap</code> attribute is in the <a state for="textarea">Hard</a> state,
    insert U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED (CRLF) character pairs into the string using a user agent-defined algorithm
    so that each line has no more than <a>character width</a> characters. For
    the purposes of this requirement, lines are delimited by the start of the string, the end of the
    string, and U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN U+000A LINE FEED (CRLF) character pairs.</li>

  </ol>

  The <dfn element-attr for="textarea"><code>maxlength</code></dfn> attribute is a <a>form control <code>maxlength</code> attribute</a>
  controlled by the <{textarea}> element's <a for="textarea">dirty value flag</a>.

  If the <{textarea}> element has a <a>maximum allowed value length</a>, then the
  element's children must be such that the <a>code-unit length</a> of the value of the
  element's {{Node/textContent}} IDL attribute with the <a>textarea wrapping
  transformation</a> applied is equal to or less than the element's <a>maximum allowed value
  length</a>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="textarea"><code>minlength</code></dfn> attribute is a <a>form control <code>minlength</code> attribute</a>
  controlled by the <{textarea}> element's <a for="textarea">dirty value flag</a>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="textarea"><code>required</code></dfn> attribute is a
  <a>boolean attribute</a>. When specified, the user will be required to enter a value before
  submitting the form.

  <strong>Constraint validation</strong>: If the element has its <code>required</code> attribute specified, and the element is
  <a>mutable</a>, and the element's <a for="forms">value</a> is the empty string, then the element is <a>suffering
  from being missing</a>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="textarea"><code>placeholder</code></dfn> attribute represents
  a <em>short</em> hint (a word or short phrase) intended to aid the user with data entry when the
  control has no value. A hint could be a sample value or a brief description of the expected
  format.

  The <code>placeholder</code> attribute
  should not be used as a replacement for a <{label}>. For a
  longer hint or other advisory text, place the text next to the control.

  <p class="note">
    Use of the <code>placeholder</code>
    attribute as a replacement for a <{label}> can reduce the
    accessibility and usability of the control for a range of users including older
    users and users with cognitive, mobility, fine motor skill or vision impairments.
    While the hint given by the control's <{label}> is shown at all times, the short
    hint given in the <code>placeholder</code>
    attribute is only shown before the user enters a value. Furthermore,
    <code>placeholder</code> text may be mistaken for
    a pre-filled value, and as commonly implemented the default color of the placeholder text
    provides insufficient contrast and the lack of a separate visible <{label}>
    reduces the size of the hit region available for setting focus on the control.
  </p>

  User agents should present this hint to the user when the element's <a for="forms">value</a> is the empty string and the control is not
  <a>focused</a> (e.g., by displaying it inside a blank unfocused control). All U+000D CARRIAGE
  RETURN U+000A LINE FEED character pairs (CRLF) in the hint, as well as all other U+000D CARRIAGE
  RETURN (CR) and U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters in the hint, must be treated as line breaks when
  rendering the hint.

  The <{textarea/name}> attribute represents the element's name.
  The <{textarea/dirname}> attribute controls how the element's <a>directionality</a> is submitted.
  The <{textarea/disabled}> attribute is used to make the control non-interactive and to prevent its
  value from being submitted.
  The <{textarea/form}> attribute is used to explicitly associate the
  <{textarea}> element with its <a>form owner</a>.
  The <{textarea/autofocus}> attribute controls focus.
  The <{textarea/autocapitalize}> attribute hints how the user agent should automatically capitalize text that the user enters.
  The <{textarea/autocomplete}> attribute controls how the user agent provides autofill behavior.

  The {{HTMLTextAreaElement/willValidate}}, {{HTMLTextAreaElement/validity}}, and
  {{HTMLTextAreaElement/validationMessage}} IDL attributes,
  and the {{HTMLTextAreaElement/checkValidity()}}, {{HTMLTextAreaElement/reportValidity()}}, and
  {{HTMLTextAreaElement/setCustomValidity()}} methods, are part of the
  <a>constraint validation API</a>.
  The {{HTMLTextAreaElement/labels}} IDL attribute provides a list of the element's <{label}>s.
  The {{HTMLTextAreaElement/select()}},
  {{HTMLTextAreaElement/selectionStart}},
  {{HTMLTextAreaElement/selectionEnd}},
  {{HTMLTextAreaElement/selectionDirection}},
  {{HTMLTextAreaElement/setRangeText()}}, and
  {{HTMLTextAreaElement/setSelectionRange()}} methods and IDL
  attributes expose the element's text selection.
  The {{HTMLTextAreaElement/autofocus}},
  {{HTMLTextAreaElement/disabled}},
  {{HTMLTextAreaElement/form}}, and
  {{HTMLTextAreaElement/name}} IDL attributes are part of the element's forms API.

  <div class="example">
    Here is an example of a <{textarea}> being used for unrestricted free-form text input in a form:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <div>
        <label>
          If you have any comments, please let us know:
          <textarea cols="80" name="comments"></textarea>
        </label>
      </div>
    </xmp>

    To specify a maximum length for the comments, one can use the <code>maxlength</code> attribute:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <div>
        <label>
          If you have any short comments, please let us know:
          <textarea cols="80" name="comments" maxlength="200"></textarea>
        </label>
      </div>
    </xmp>

    To give a default value, text can be included inside the element:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <div>
        <label>
          If you have any comments, please let us know:
          <textarea cols="80" name="comments">You rock!</textarea>
      </label>
      </div>
    </xmp>

    You can also give a minimum length. Here, a letter needs to be filled out by the user; a
    template (which is shorter than the minimum length) is provided, but is insufficient to submit
    the form:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <textarea required minlength="500">Dear Madam Speaker,

      Regarding your letter dated ...

      ...

      Yours Sincerely,

      ...</textarea>
    </xmp>

    A placeholder can be given as well, to suggest the basic form to the user, without providing
    an explicit template:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <textarea placeholder="Dear Francine,

      They closed the parks this week, so we won't be able to meet your there. Should we just have dinner?

      Love,
      Daddy"></textarea>
    </xmp>

    To have the browser submit <a>the directionality</a> of the element along with the
    value, the <code>dirname</code> attribute can be specified:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <div>
        <label>
          If you have any comments, please let us know (you may use either English or Hebrew for your comments):
          <textarea cols="80" name="comments" dirname="comments.dir"></textarea>
        </label>
      </div>

  The <{output}> element <a>represents</a> the result of a calculation performed
  by the application, or the result of a user action.

  <p class="note">
    This element can be contrasted with the <{samp}> element, which is the
  appropriate element for quoting the output of other programs run previously.
  </p>

  The <dfn element-attr for="output"><code>for</code></dfn> content attribute allows an explicit
  relationship to be made between the result of a calculation and the elements that represent the
  values that went into the calculation or that otherwise influenced the calculation. The <{output/for}> attribute, if specified, must contain a string consisting of
  an <a>unordered set of unique space-separated tokens</a> that are
  <a>case-sensitive</a>, each of which must have the value of an <a>ID</a> of an element in the same {{Document}}.

  The <{output/form}> attribute is used to explicitly associate the
  <{output}> element with its <a>form owner</a>. The <{output/name}> attribute represents the element's name. The <{output}>
  element is associated with a form so that it can be easily referenced from the event handlers of
  form controls; the element's value itself is not submitted when the form is submitted.

  The element has a <dfn>value mode flag</dfn> which is either <i>value</i> or <i>default</i>.
  Initially, the <a>value mode flag</a> must be set to <i>default</i>.

  The element also has a <dfn for="output">default value</dfn>.
  Initially, the <a for="output">default value</a> must be the empty

  The <{progress}> element <a>represents</a> progress of a task, either as a fraction of the total that has been completed,
  or merely that progress is occurring.

  <p class="note">
  The <{progress}> element is the wrong element to for a simple gauge, as opposed to task progress.
  The <{meter}> element is more appropriate for such use cases. It allows arbitrary minimum as well as maximum values.
  </p>

  The <dfn element-attr for="progress"><code>value</code></dfn> content attribute specifies how much of the
  task has been completed. When the attribute is present the value must be a <a>valid floating-point number</a>
  in the range [0,<a for="progress">maximum value</a>].
  If the attribute is missing, the element is an <dfn>indeterminate progress bar</dfn>, and should show something is happening
  but that it is not clear how much more work remains to be done before the task is complete, for example
  waiting for a response to a network request. If the attribute is present, the element is a <dfn>determinate progress bar</dfn>.

  The <dfn element-attr for="progress"><code>max</code></dfn> content attribute specifies how much work the task requires.
  When the attribuite is present, the value must be a <a>valid floating-point number</a> greater than zero.
  The <a>missing value default</a> is 1.0.

  The units are arbitrary and not specified.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLProgressElement"><code>max</code></dfn> IDL attribute must

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLProgressElement"><code>value</code></dfn> IDL attribute provides the amount of the task complete
  for a <a>determinate progress bar</a> or 0 for an <a>indeterminate progress bar</a>.
  On setting, the given value must be converted to the
  <a lt="best floating-point number">best representation of the number as a floating-point number</a>
  and then the <{progress/value}> content attribute must be set to that string.

  The {{HTMLProgressElement/labels}} IDL attribute provides a list of the element's <{label}>s.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLProgressElement"><code>position</code></dfn> IDL attribute

    For an indeterminate progress bar, returns -1.

    </dd>

  </dl>

  <strong>user agent requirements for showing the progress bar</strong>: When representing a
  <{progress}> element to the user, the user agent should indicate whether it is a determinate or
  indeterminate progress bar. For a <a>determinate progress bar</a> the user agent should indicate the
  <a for="progress">current value</a> relative to the <a for="progress">maximum value</a>,
  e.g. by filling an appropriate fraction of the widget in a contrasting color.

<h5 id="sec-determinate-progress-bar">Determinate progress bars</h5>

  Authors are encouraged to include the current value and the <a for="progress">maximum value</a> inline as text
  inside the element, so that the progress is made available to users of legacy user agents.

  <div class="example">
    Here is a snippet of a Web application that shows the progress of some automated task:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <section>
        <h2>Task Progress</h2>
        <p>
          Progress:
          <progress id="pbar" max="100" value="0">
            <span id="pVal">0</span>%
          </progress>
        </p>

        <script>
          var progressBar = document.getElementById('pbar');

          function updateProgress(newValue) {
            progressBar.value = newValue;
            progressBar.querySelector('#pVal')[0].textContent = newValue;
          }
        </script>
      </section>
    </xmp>

    (The <code>updateProgress()</code> method in this example would be called by some
    other code on the page to update the actual progress bar as the task progressed.)

  </div>

  If the element has a <{progress/max}> attribute, the user agent must parse the attribute's value according to the
  <a>rules for parsing floating-point number values</a>.

  If this does not result in an error, and if the parsed value is greater than zero, then the
  <dfn for="progress">maximum value</dfn> of the progress bar is that value.

  Otherwise the <a for="progress">maximum value</a> of the progress bar is 1.0.

  User agents must parse the <{progress/value}> attribute's value according to the <a>rules for
  parsing floating-point number values</a>. If this results in an error, or if the
  parsed value is less than zero, then the <dfn for="progress">current value</dfn> of the progress bar is zero.

  Otherwise, the <a for="progress">current value</a> of the progress bar is the lesser of the parsed value and the
  <a for="progress">maximum value</a> of the progress bar.

  The {{HTMLProgressElement/position}} IDL attribute must return the
  result of dividing the <a for="progress">current value</a> by the <a for="progress">maximum value</a>.

<h5 id="sec-indeterminate-progress-bar">Indeterminate progress bars</h5>

  <div class="example">
    Here is a snippet of a Web application that shows whether a task is complete:

    <xmp highlight="html">

            progressBar.textContent = "Done";
          }
        </script>
      </section>
    </xmp>

    The <code>finishedWorking()</code> method in this example would be called by some
    other code on the page to update the actual progress bar when the task is complete.

    Setting the {{HTMLProgressElement/value}} there changes the element to a
    <a>determinate progress bar</a>.
  </div>

  The {{HTMLProgressElement/position}} IDL attribute must return -1.

  The <{meter}> element <a>represents</a> a scalar measurement within a known
  range, or a fractional value; for example disk usage, the relevance of a query result, or the
  fraction of a voting population to have selected a particular candidate.

  This is also known as a gauge.

  <p class="note">
    The <{meter}> element should not be used to indicate progress (as in a
  progress bar). For that role, HTML provides a separate <{progress}> element.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    The <{meter}> element also does not represent a scalar value of arbitrary
  range — for example, it would be wrong to use this to report a weight, or height, unless
  there is a known <a for="meter">maximum value</a>.
  </p>

  There are six attributes that determine the semantics of the gauge represented by the element.

  The <dfn element-attr for="meter"><code>min</code></dfn> attribute specifies the lower bound of
  the range, and the <dfn element-attr for="meter"><code>max</code></dfn> attribute specifies the
  upper bound. The <dfn element-attr for="meter"><code>value</code></dfn> attribute specifies the
  value to have the gauge indicate as the "measured" value.

  The other three attributes can be used to segment the gauge's range into "low", "medium", and
  "high" parts, and to indicate which part of the gauge is the "optimum" part. The <dfn element-attr for="meter"><code>low</code></dfn> attribute specifies the range that is considered to
  be the "low" part, and the <dfn element-attr for="meter"><code>high</code></dfn> attribute
  specifies the range that is considered to be the "high" part. The <dfn element-attr for="meter"><code>optimum</code></dfn> attribute gives the position that is
  "optimum"; if that is higher than the "high" value then this indicates that the higher the value,
  the better; if it's lower than the "low" mark then it indicates that lower values are better, and
  naturally if it is in between then it indicates that neither high nor low values are good.

  <strong>Authoring requirements</strong>: The <{meter/value}> attribute must be specified.
  The <{meter/value}>, <{meter/min}>, <{meter/low}>, <{meter/high}>, <{meter/max}>, and <{meter/optimum}>
  attributes, when present, must have values that are <a>valid floating-point numbers</a>.

  In addition, the attributes' values are further constrained:

  Let <var>value</var> be the <{meter/value}> attribute's number.

  If the <{meter/min}> attribute is specified, then let <var>minimum</var> be that attribute's value;
  otherwise, let it be zero.

  If the <{meter/max}> attribute is specified, then let <var>maximum</var> be that attribute's value;
  otherwise, let it be 1.0.

  The following inequalities must hold, as applicable:

  <ul class="brief">

    <li><var>minimum</var> ≤ <var>value</var> ≤ <var>maximum</var></li>

    <li><var>minimum</var> ≤ <code>low</code> ≤ <var>maximum</var> (if <code>low</code> is specified)</li>

    <li><var>minimum</var> ≤ <code>high</code> ≤ <var>maximum</var> (if <code>high</code> is specified)</li>

    <li><var>minimum</var> ≤ <code>optimum</code> ≤ <var>maximum</var> (if <code>optimum</code> is specified)</li>

    <li><code>low</code> ≤ <code>high</code> (if
    both <code>low</code> and <code>high</code> are
    specified)</li>

  </ul>

  <p class="note">
    If no minimum or maximum is specified, then the range is assumed to be 0..1, and
  the value thus has to be within that range.
  </p>

  Authors are encouraged to include a textual representation of the gauge's state in the
  element's contents, for users of user agents that do not support the <{meter}> element.

  When used with microdata, the <{meter}> element's <{meter/value}> attribute provides the element's machine-readable value.

  <div class="example">
    The following examples show three gauges that would all be three-quarters full:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      Storage space usage: <meter value="6" max="8">6 blocks used (out of 8 total)</meter>
      Voter turnout: <meter value="0.75"><img alt="75%" src="graph75.png"></meter>
      Tickets sold: <meter min="0" max="100" value="75"></meter>
    </xmp>

    The following example is incorrect use of the element, because it doesn't give a range (and
    since the default maximum is 1, both of the gauges would end up looking maxed out):

    <xmp highlight="html" class="bad">
      <p>The grapefruit pie had a radius of <meter value="12">12cm</meter> and a height of <meter value="2">2cm</meter>.</p>
      <!-- BAD! -->
    </xmp>

    Instead, one would either not include the meter element, or use the meter element with a
    defined range to give the dimensions in context compared to other pies:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <p>The grapefruit pie had a radius of 12cm and a height of 2cm.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Radius:</dt>
        <dd><meter min="0" max="20" value="12">12cm</meter></dd>
        <dt>Height:</dt>
        <dd><meter min="0" max="10" value="2">2cm</meter></dd>
      </dl>
    </xmp>

  </div>

  There is no explicit way to specify units in the <{meter}> element, but the units may
  be specified in the <{meter/title}> attribute in free-form text.

  <div class="example">
    The example above could be extended to mention the units:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <dl>
        <dt>Radius:</dt>
        <dd><meter min="0" max="20" value="12" title="centimeters">12cm</meter></dd>
        <dt>Height:</dt>
        <dd><meter min="0" max="10" value="2" title="centimeters">2cm</meter></dd>
      </dl>
    </xmp>

  </div>

  <strong>User agent requirements</strong>: User agents must parse the
  <{meter/min}>, <{meter/max}>, <{meter/value}>, <{meter/low}>, <{meter/high}>, and <{meter/optimum}>
  attributes using the <a>rules for parsing floating-point number values</a>.

  User agents must then use all these numbers to obtain values for six points on the gauge, as
  follows. (The order in which these are evaluated is important, as some of the values refer to
  earlier ones.)

  <dl>

    <dt>The <dfn for="meter">minimum value</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    If the <{meter/min}> attribute is specified and a value could be
    parsed out of it, then the <a for="meter">minimum value</a> is that value. Otherwise,
    the <a for="meter">minimum value</a> is zero.

    </dd>

    <dt>The <dfn for="meter">maximum value</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    If the <{meter/max}> attribute is specified and a value could be
    parsed out of it, then the candidate <a for="meter">maximum value</a> is that value. Otherwise, the candidate
    <a for="meter">maximum value</a> is 1.0.

    If the candidate <a for="meter">maximum value</a> is greater than or equal to the <a for="meter">minimum value</a>, then the
    <a for="meter">maximum value</a> is the candidate <a for="meter">maximum value</a>. Otherwise, the <a for="meter">maximum value</a> is the same as the
    <a for="meter">minimum value</a>.

    </dd>

    <dt>The <dfn for="meter">actual value</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    If the <{meter/value}> attribute is specified and a value could
    be parsed out of it, then that value is the candidate actual value. Otherwise, the candidate
    actual value is zero.

    If the candidate actual value is less than the <a for="meter">minimum value</a>, then the actual value is the
    <a for="meter">minimum value</a>.

    Otherwise, if the candidate actual value is greater than the <a for="meter">maximum value</a>, then the actual
    value is the <a for="meter">maximum value</a>.

    Otherwise, the actual value is the candidate actual value.

    </dd>

    <dt>The <dfn for="meter">low boundary</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    If the <{meter/low}> attribute is specified and a value could be
    parsed out of it, then the candidate low boundary is that value. Otherwise, the candidate low
    boundary is the same as the <a for="meter">minimum value</a>.

    If the candidate low boundary is less than the <a for="meter">minimum value</a>, then the low boundary is the
    <a for="meter">minimum value</a>.

    Otherwise, if the candidate low boundary is greater than the <a for="meter">maximum value</a>, then the low
    boundary is the <a for="meter">maximum value</a>.

    Otherwise, the low boundary is the candidate low boundary.

    </dd>

    <dt>The <dfn for="meter">high boundary</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    If the <{meter/high}> attribute is specified and a value could be
    parsed out of it, then the candidate high boundary is that value. Otherwise, the candidate high
    boundary is the same as the <a for="meter">maximum value</a>.

    If the candidate high boundary is less than the low boundary, then the high boundary is the
    low boundary.

    Otherwise, if the candidate high boundary is greater than the <a for="meter">maximum value</a>, then the high
    boundary is the <a for="meter">maximum value</a>.

    Otherwise, the high boundary is the candidate high boundary.

    </dd>

    <dt>The <dfn for="meter" lt="optimum value|optimum point">optimum point</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    If the <{meter/optimum}> attribute is specified and a value
    could be parsed out of it, then the candidate optimum point is that value. Otherwise, the
    candidate optimum point is the midpoint between the <a for="meter">minimum value</a> and the <a for="meter">maximum value</a>.

    If the candidate optimum point is less than the <a for="meter">minimum value</a>, then the optimum point is the
    <a for="meter">minimum value</a>.

    Otherwise, if the candidate optimum point is greater than the <a for="meter">maximum value</a>, then the optimum
    point is the <a for="meter">maximum value</a>.

    Otherwise, the optimum point is the candidate optimum point.

    </dd>

  </dl>

  All of which will result in the following inequalities all being true:

  <ul class="brief">
    <li>minimum value ≤ actual value ≤ maximum value</li>
    <li>minimum value ≤ low boundary ≤ high boundary ≤ maximum value</li>
    <li>minimum value ≤ optimum point ≤ maximum value</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>user agent requirements for regions of the gauge</strong>: If the optimum point is equal to the
  low boundary or the high boundary, or anywhere in between them, then the region between the low
  and high boundaries of the gauge must be treated as the optimum region, and the low and high
  parts, if any, must be treated as suboptimal. Otherwise, if the optimum point is less than the low
  boundary, then the region between the <a for="meter">minimum value</a> and the low boundary must be treated as the
  optimum region, the region from the low boundary up to the high boundary must be treated as a
  suboptimal region, and the remaining region must be treated as an even less good region. Finally,
  if the optimum point is higher than the high boundary, then the situation is reversed; the region
  between the high boundary and the <a for="meter">maximum value</a> must be treated as the optimum region, the region
  from the high boundary down to the low boundary must be treated as a suboptimal region, and the
  remaining region must be treated as an even less good region.

  <strong>user agent requirements for showing the gauge</strong>: When representing a <{meter}>
  element to the user, the user agent should indicate the relative position of the actual value to the
  minimum and maximum values, and the relationship between the actual value and the three regions of
  the gauge.

  The <{fieldset}> element <a>represents</a> a set of form controls optionally
  grouped under a common name.

  The name of the group is given by the first <{legend}> element that is a child of the
  <{fieldset}> element, if any. The remainder of the descendants form the group.

  The <dfn element-attr for="fieldset"><code>disabled</code></dfn> attribute, when specified,
  causes all the form control descendants of the <{fieldset}> element, excluding those that
  are descendants of the <{fieldset}> element's first <{legend}> element child, if
  any, to be disabled.

  A <{fieldset}> element is a <dfn>disabled fieldset</dfn> if it matches any of the
  following conditions:

  <ul>

    <li>Its <{fieldset/disabled}> attribute is specified</li>
    <li>It is a descendant of another <{fieldset}> element whose <{fieldset/disabled}> attribute is specified, and is <em>not</em> a
    descendant of that <{fieldset}> element's first <{legend}> element child, if
    any.</li>

  </ul>

  The <{fieldset/form}> attribute is used to explicitly associate the
  <{fieldset}> element with its <a>form owner</a>. The <{fieldset/name}> attribute represents the element's name.

  <dl class="domintro">

    <dt><var>fieldset</var> . <code>type</code></dt>

    <dd>

    <dt><var>fieldset</var> . <code>elements</code></dt>

    <dd>

    Returns an <code>HTMLCollection</code> of the form controls in the element.

    </dd>

  </dl>

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLFieldSetElement"><code>disabled</code></dfn> IDL attribute must
  <a>reflect</a> the content attribute of the same name.

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLFieldSetElement"><code>type</code></dfn> IDL attribute must return
  the string "<code>fieldset</code>".

  The <dfn attribute for="HTMLFieldSetElement"><code>elements</code></dfn> IDL attribute must

  </div>

  <div class="example">
    The following snippet shows a <{fieldset}> with a checkbox in the <{legend}> that controls
    whether or not the <code>fieldset</code> is enabled. The contents of the <code>fieldset</code>
    consist of two required text fields and an optional year/month control.

    <xmp highlight="html">

  <div class="example">
    You can also nest <{fieldset}> elements. Here is an example expanding on the previous
    one that does so:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <fieldset name="clubfields" disabled>
        <legend>
          <label>
            <input type="checkbox" name="club" onchange="form.clubfields.disabled = !checked">
            Use Club Card
          </label>
        </legend>
        <div>
          <label>
            Name on card:
            <input name="clubname" required>
          </label>
        </div>
        <fieldset name="numfields">
          <legend>
            <label>
            <input type="radio" checked name="clubtype" onchange="form.numfields.disabled = !checked">
            My card has numbers on it
            </label>
          </legend>
          <div>
            <label>
              Card number:
              <input name="clubnum" required pattern="\[-0-9]+">
            </label>
          </div>
        </fieldset>
        <fieldset name="letfields" disabled>
          <legend>
            <label>
              <input type="radio" name="clubtype" onchange="form.letfields.disabled = !checked">
              My card has letters on it
            </label>
          </legend>
          <div>
            <label>
              Card code:
              <input name="clublet" required pattern="[A-Za-z]+">

          </div>
        </fieldset>
      </fieldset>
    </xmp>

    In this example, if the outer "Use Club Card" checkbox is not checked, everything inside the
    outer <{fieldset}>, including the two radio buttons in the legends of the two nested
    <code>fieldset</code>s, will be disabled. However, if the checkbox is checked, then the radio
    buttons will both be enabled and will let you select which of the two inner
    <code>fieldset</code>s is to be enabled.

    <dd>
      Returns the element's <{form}> element, if any, or null otherwise.

  </dl>

  The {{HTMLLegendElement/form}} IDL attribute's behavior depends on whether the <{legend}>
  element is within a <{fieldset}> element or not. If the <{legend}> has a <{fieldset}> element
  as its parent, then the {{HTMLLegendElement/form}} IDL attribute must return the same value as
  the {{HTMLFieldSetElement/form}} IDL attribute on that <{fieldset}> element.
  Otherwise, it must return null.

  A <{legend}> will often contain <a>phrasing content</a> to provide a caption to the rest of
  the contents of its parent <{fieldset}>. When appropriate, a <{legend}> may contain a heading
  element (<{h1}>-<{h6}>), if the caption of the <{fieldset}> would provide value to the
  document's <a>outline</a>.

  <div class="example">
    An example of when an author may wish to use a heading within a <{legend}> is when a
    <{form}> contains many subsections.

<h4 id="form-control-infrastructure">Form control infrastructure</h4>

<h5 id="a-form-control-value">A form control value</h5>

  Most form controls have a <dfn for="forms">value</dfn> and a <dfn for="forms">checkedness</dfn>.
  (The latter is only used by <{input}> elements.) These are used to describe how the user
  interacts with the control.

  A control's <a for="forms">value</a> is its internal state. As such, it
  might not match the user's current input.

  <p class="example">
    For instance, if a user enters the word "<kbd>three</kbd>" into a numeric field that expects
    digits, the user's input would be the string "three" but the control's
    <a for="forms">value</a> would remain unchanged. Or, if a user enters the email address
    "<kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;awesome@example.com</kbd>" (with leading white space) into
    <{input/E-mail|an email field}>, the user's input would be the string
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;awesome@example.com" but the browser's UI for email fields might translate that
    into a <a for="forms">value</a> of "<code>awesome@example.com</code>" (without the leading
    white space).
  </p>

  To define the behavior of constraint validation in the face of the <{input}> element's
  <{input/multiple}> attribute, <{input}> elements can also have separately defined
  <a for="forms">value<em>s</em></a>.

  The <{select}> element does not have a <a for="forms">value</a>;
  the <a state for="option">selectedness</a> of its <{option}> elements is what is used instead.

<h5 id="mutability">Mutability</h5>

  A form control can be designated as <dfn>mutable</dfn>.

  <p class="note">This determines (by means of definitions and requirements in this specification
  that rely on whether an element is so designated) whether or not the user can modify the
  <a for="forms">value</a> or <a for="forms">checkedness</a> of a form control, or whether or not a
  control can be automatically prefilled.</p>

<h5 id="association-of-controls-and-forms">Association of controls and forms</h5>

  A <a>form-associated element</a> can have a relationship with a <{form}> element, which is
  called the element's <dfn>form owner</dfn>. If a <a>form-associated element</a> is not
  associated with a <{form}> element, its <a>form owner</a> is said to be null.

  A <a>form-associated element</a> is, by default, associated with its nearest ancestor
  <{form}> element (as described below), but, if it is <a>reassociateable</a>, may have a
  <dfn element-attr for="formelements,object,label,input,button,select,textarea,output,fieldset"><code>form</code></dfn>
  attribute specified to override this.

  <p class="note">
    This feature allows authors to work around the lack of support for nested <{form}> elements.
  </p>

  If a <a>reassociateable</a> <a>form-associated
  element</a> has a <{formelements/form}> attribute specified, then that
  attribute's value must be the <a>ID</a> of a <{form}> element
  in the element's owner {{Document}}.

  <p class="note">
    The rules in this section are complicated by the fact that although conforming documents will
    never contain nested <{form}> elements, it is quite possible (e.g., using a script that
    performs DOM manipulation) to generate documents that have such nested elements. They are also
    complicated by rules in the HTML parser that, for historical reasons, can result in a
    <a>form-associated element</a> being associated with a <{form}> element that is not
    its ancestor.
  </p>

  When a <a>form-associated element</a> is created, its <a>form owner</a> must be
  initialized to null (no owner).

  When a <a>form-associated element</a> is to be <dfn>associated</dfn> with a form, its
  <a>form owner</a> must be set to that form.

  When a <a>form-associated element</a> or one of its ancestors is
  <a for="document">inserted into a <code>Document</code></a>, then the user agent must
  <a>reset the form owner</a> of that <a>form-associated element</a>.
  <span class="note">The <a>HTML parser</a> overrides this requirement when inserting form
  controls.</span>

  When an element changes its parent node resulting in a <a>form-associated element</a> and
  its <a>form owner</a> (if any) no longer being in the same <a>tree</a>, then
  the user agent must <a>reset the form owner</a> of that <a>form-associated element</a>.

  When a <a>reassociateable</a> <a>form-associated element</a>'s <{formelements/form}> attribute
  is set, changed, or removed, then the user agent must <a>reset the form owner</a>
  of that element.

  When a <a>reassociateable</a> <a>form-associated element</a> has a
  <{formelements/form}> attribute and the <a>ID</a> of any of the elements in
  the {{Document}} changes, then the user agent must <a>reset the form owner</a>
  of that <a>form-associated element</a>.

  When a <a>reassociateable</a> <a>form-associated element</a> has a <{formelements/form}>
  attribute and an element with an <a>ID</a> is <a for="document">inserted into</a> or
  <a for="document">removed from</a> the {{Document}}, then the user agent must
  <a>reset the form owner</a> of that <a>form-associated element</a>.

  When the user agent is to <dfn>reset the form owner</dfn> of a <a>form-associated element</a>,
  it must run the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>If the element's <a>form owner</a> is not null, and either the element is not
    <a>reassociateable</a> or its <{formelements/form}> content attribute is not present,
    and the element's <a>form owner</a> is its nearest <{form}> element ancestor after the
    change to the ancestor chain, then do nothing, and abort these steps.</li>

    <li>Let the element's <a>form owner</a> be null.</li>

    <li>

    If the element is <a>reassociateable</a>, has a <{formelements/form}> content attribute,
    and is itself <a>in a <code>Document</code></a>, then run these substeps:

    <ol>

      <li>If the first element in the <code>Document</code> to have an <a>ID</a> that is
      <a>case-sensitively</a> equal to the element's <{formelements/form}> content attribute's
      value is a <{form}> element, then associate the <a>form-associated element</a> with that
      <{form}> element.</li>

      <li>Abort the "reset the form owner" steps.</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    <li>Otherwise, if the <a>form-associated element</a> in question has an ancestor
    <{form}> element, then associate the <a>form-associated element</a> with the nearest such
    ancestor <{form}> element.</li>

    <li>Otherwise, the element is left unassociated.</li>

  </ol>

  <div class="example">
    In the following non-conforming snippet:

    <xmp class="bad" highlight="html">
      ...
      <form id="a">
        <div id="b"></div>
      </form>
      <script>
        document.getElementById('b').innerHTML =
          '<table><tr><td></form><form id="c"><input id="d"></table>' +
          '<input id="e">';
      </script>
      ...
    </xmp>

    The <a>form owner</a> of "d" would be the inner nested form "c", while the <a>form owner</a>
    of "e" would be the outer form "a".

    This happens as follows: First, the "e" node gets associated with "c" in the
    <a>HTML parser</a>. Then, the <code>innerHTML</code> algorithm moves the nodes
    from the temporary document to the "b" element. At this point, the nodes see their ancestor
    chain change, and thus all the "magic" associations done by the parser are reset to normal
    ancestor associations.

    This example is a non-conforming document, though, as it is a violation of the content models
    to nest <{form}> elements, and there is a [=parse error=] for the <code>&lt;/form></code> tag.

  </div>

  <dl class="domintro">

<h4 id="attributes-common-to-form-controls">Attributes common to form controls</h4>

<h5 id="naming-form-controls-the-name-attribute">Naming form controls: the <code>name</code> attribute</h5>

  The
  <dfn element-attr for="formelements,label,input,button,select,textarea,output,fieldset"><code>name</code></dfn>
  content attribute gives the name of the form control, as used in [[#forms-form-submission]] and
  in the <{form}> element's <code>elements</code> object. If the attribute is specified, its value
  must not be the empty string.

  Any non-empty value for <{formelements/name}> is allowed, but the name
  "<code>_charset_</code>" is special:

  : <dfn attr-value for="formelements/name"><code>_charset_</code></dfn>
  :: This value, if used as the name of a <{input/Hidden}>
     control with no <code>value</code> attribute, is automatically given a
     value during submission consisting of the submission character encoding.

  The
  <dfn attribute for="HTMLInputElement,HTMLButtonElement,HTMLSelectElement,HTMLTextAreaElement,HTMLOutputElement,HTMLFieldSetElement"><code>name</code></dfn>
  IDL attribute must <a>reflect</a> the <{formelements/name}> content attribute.

<h5 id="submitting-element-directionality-the-dirname-attribute">Submitting element directionality: the <code>dirname</code> attribute</h5>

  The <dfn element-attr for="input,textarea"><code>dirname</code></dfn> attribute on a form control
  element enables the submission of <a>the directionality</a> of the element, and gives the name of
  the field that contains this value during [[#forms-form-submission]]. If such an attribute is
  specified, its value must not be the empty string.

  <div class="example">
    In this example, a form contains a text field and a submission button:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <form action="/addcomment" method="post">
        <div>
          <label for="add-comment">Comment:</label>
          <input type="text" id="add-comment" name="comment" dirname="comment.dir" required>
        </div>
        <div>
          <button name="mode" type="submit" value="add">Post Comment</button>
        </div>
      </form>
    </xmp>

    When the user submits the form, the user agent includes three fields, one called "comment",
    one called "comment.dir", and one called "mode"; so if the user types "Hello", the submission
    body might be something like:

    <pre>comment=Hello&amp;<strong>comment.dir=ltr</strong>&amp;mode=add</pre>

    If the user manually switches to a right-to-left writing direction and enters "<span dir="rtl" lang="ar">مرحبا</span>", the submission body might be
    something like:

<h5 id="limiting-user-input-length-the-maxlength-attribute">Limiting user input length: the <code>maxlength</code> attribute</h5>

  A <dfn>form control <code>maxlength</code> attribute</dfn>,
  controlled by a <var>dirty value flag</var>, declares a limit on the number of characters
  a user can input.

  If an element has its <a>form control <code>maxlength</code> attribute</a> specified, the
  attribute's value must be a <a>valid non-negative integer</a>. If the attribute is specified and
  applying the <a>rules for parsing non-negative integers</a> to its value results in a number,
  then that number is the element's <dfn>maximum allowed value length</dfn>. If the attribute is
  omitted or parsing its value results in an error, then there is no
  <a>maximum allowed value length</a>.

  <strong>Constraint validation</strong>: If an element has a <a>maximum allowed value
  length</a>, its <var>dirty value flag</var> is true, its <a for="forms">value</a> was last changed by a user edit (as opposed to a change made
  by a script), and the <a>code-unit length</a> of the element's <a for="forms">value</a> is greater than the element's <a>maximum allowed value
  length</a>, then the element is <a>suffering from being too long</a>.

  User agents may prevent the user from causing the element's <a for="forms">value</a> to be set to a value whose <a>code-unit length</a> is
  greater than the element's <a>maximum allowed value length</a>.

  <p class="note">
    In the case of <{textarea}> elements, this is the <a for="forms">value</a>, not the <a>raw
  value</a>, so the <a>textarea wrapping transformation</a> is applied before the
  <a>maximum allowed value length</a> is checked.
  </p>

<h5 id="setting-minimum-input-length-requirements-the-minlength-attribute">Setting minimum input length requirements: the <code>minlength</code> attribute</h5>

  A <dfn>form control <code>minlength</code> attribute</dfn>,
  controlled by a <var>dirty value flag</var>, declares a lower bound on the number of
  characters a user can input.

  <p class="note">
    The <code>minlength</code> attribute does not imply the
  <code>required</code> attribute. If the form control has no <code>required</code> attribute, then the value can still be omitted; the
  <code>minlength</code> attribute only kicks in once the user has entered
  a value at all. If the empty string is not allowed, then the <code>required</code>
  attribute also needs to be set.
  </p>

  If an element has its <a>form control <code>minlength</code> attribute</a> specified, the attribute's value must be a <a>valid
  non-negative integer</a>. If the attribute is specified and applying the <a>rules for
  parsing non-negative integers</a> to its value results in a number, then that number is the
  element's <dfn>minimum allowed value length</dfn>. If the attribute is omitted or parsing its
  value results in an error, then there is no <a>minimum allowed value length</a>.

  If an element has both a <a>maximum allowed value length</a> and a <a>minimum allowed
  value length</a>, the <a>minimum allowed value length</a> must be smaller than or equal
  to the <a>maximum allowed value length</a>.

  <strong>Constraint validation</strong>: If an element has a <a>minimum allowed value
  length</a>, its <var>dirty value flag</var> is true, its <a for="forms">value</a> was last changed by a user edit (as opposed to a change made
  by a script), its <a for="forms">value</a> is not the empty string, and the
  <a>code-unit length</a> of the element's <a for="forms">value</a> is less
  than the element's <a>minimum allowed value length</a>, then the element is <a>suffering
  from being too short</a>.

  <div class="example">
    In this example, there are four text fields. The first is required, and has to be at least 5

  The <dfn element-attr for="disabledformelements,input,button,select,textarea"><code>disabled</code></dfn> content attribute is a
  <a>boolean attribute</a>.

  A form control is disabled if any of the following
  conditions are met:

  <ol>

    <li>The element is a <{button}>, <{input}>, <{option}>, <{select}>, or
    <{textarea}> element, and the <code>disabled</code> attribute
    is specified on this element (regardless of its value).</li>

    <!-- Note. option/disabled and optgroup/disabled are defined in the relevant element descriptions.
    That is repeated here for clarity -->

    <li>The element is an <{option}> element that is a child of an
    <{optgroup}> element that has the <{optgroup/disabled}> attribute specified.</li>

    <li>The element is a descendant of a <{fieldset}> element whose <code>disabled</code> attribute is specified, and is <em>not</em> a
    descendant of that <{fieldset}> element's first <{legend}> element child, if
    any.</li>

  </ol>

  A form control that is disabled must prevent any <a event><code>click</code></a> events that are <a>queued</a> on the
  <a>user interaction task source</a> from being dispatched on the element.

  <strong>Constraint validation</strong>: If an element is disabled, it is <a>barred from constraint
  validation</a>.

  The
  <dfn attribute for="HTMLInputElement,HTMLButtonElement,HTMLSelectElement,HTMLTextAreaElement"><code>disabled</code></dfn>
  IDL attribute must
  <a>reflect</a> the <{disabledformelements/disabled}> content attribute.

<h5 id="form-control-infrastructure-form-submission">Form submission</h5>

  <dfn for="forms">Attributes for form submission</dfn> can be specified both on <{form}> elements
  and on <a>submit buttons</a> (elements that represent buttons
  that submit forms, e.g., an <{input}> element whose <{input/type}> attribute is in the <{input/Submit|Submit Button}> state).

  The <a>attributes for form submission</a> that may be specified on <{form}> elements are
  <{form/action}>, <{form/enctype}>, <{form/method}>, <{form/novalidate}>, and <{form/target}>.

  The corresponding <a>attributes for form submission</a> that may be specified on <a>submit buttons</a> are <{submitbuttonelements/formaction}>, <{submitbuttonelements/formenctype}>, <{submitbuttonelements/formmethod}>, <{submitbuttonelements/formnovalidate}>, and <{submitbuttonelements/formtarget}>. When omitted, they default to the values given on
  the corresponding attributes on the <{form}> element.

  <hr />

  The <dfn element-attr for="form"><code>action</code></dfn> and
  <dfn element-attr for="submitbuttonelements,input,button"><code>formaction</code></dfn> content
  attributes, if specified, must have a value that is a
  <a>valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces</a>.

  The <dfn>action</dfn> of an element is the value of the element's
  <{submitbuttonelements/formaction}> attribute, if the element is a
  <{input/Submit|Submit Button}> and has such an attribute, or the value of its
  <a>form owner</a>'s <{form/action}> attribute, if <em>it</em> has one, or else the empty string.

  <hr />

  The <dfn element-attr for="form"><code>method</code></dfn> and
  <dfn element-attr for="submitbuttonelements,input,button"><code>formmethod</code></dfn> content
  attributes are <a>enumerated attributes</a> with the following keywords and states:

  <ul>

    <li>
      The keyword <dfn attr-value for="form/method"><code>get</code></dfn>, mapping to the
      state <dfn for="http">GET</dfn>, indicating the <a>HTTP GET</a> method. The GET method should
      only request and retrieve data and should have no other effect.
    </li>

    <li>
      The keyword <dfn attr-value for="form/method"><code>post</code></dfn>, mapping to the
      state <dfn for="http">POST</dfn>, indicating the <a>HTTP POST</a> method.

      The POST method requests that the server accept the submitted <{form}>'s data to be processed, which may result in an item being added to a database, the creation of a new
      web page resource, the updating of the existing page, or all of the mentioned outcomes.
    </li>

    <li>The keyword <dfn attr-value for="form/method"><code>dialog</code></dfn>, mapping to
    the state <dfn for="state">dialog</dfn>, indicating that submitting the
    <{form}> is intended to close the <code>dialog</code> box in which the form finds
    itself, if any, and otherwise not submit.</li>

  </ul>

  The <i>invalid value default</i> for these attributes is the <a for="http">GET</a> state.
  The <i>missing value default</i> for the <{form/method}> attribute is also the
  <a for="http">GET</a> state. (There is no <i>missing value default</i> for the
  <{submitbuttonelements/formmethod}> attribute.)

  The <dfn for="forms">method</dfn> of an element is one of those states. If the element is a
  <{input/Submit|Submit Button}> and has a <{submitbuttonelements/formmethod}> attribute, then the
  element's <a for="forms">method</a> is that attribute's state; otherwise, it is the
  <a>form owner</a>'s <{form/method}> attribute's state.

  <div class="example">
    Here the <{form/method}> attribute is used to explicitly specify the default value,
    "<a attr-value for="form/method">get</a>", so that the search query is submitted in the URL:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <form method="get" action="/search">

        <input type="submit">
      </form>
    </xmp>

  </div>

  <div class="example">
    On the other hand, here the <{form/method}> attribute is used to specify the value
    "<a attr-value for="form/method">post</a>", so that the user's message is submitted in
    the HTTP request's body:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <form method="post" action="/post-message">
        <div>

        </div>
      </form>
    </xmp>

  </div>

  <div class="example">
    In this example, a <{form}> is used within a <{dialog}>. The <{form/method}> attribute's
    "<a attr-value for="form/method">dialog</a>" keyword is used to have the dialog

  The <dfn element-attr for="form"><code>enctype</code></dfn> and
  <dfn element-attr for="submitbuttonelements,input,button"><code>formenctype</code></dfn>
  content attributes are <a>enumerated attributes</a> that specify how the form data should be encoded
  when a form is submitted. These attributes have the following keywords and states:

  <dl>
    <dt>The
      "<dfn attr-value for="form/enctype"><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code></dfn>"
      keyword and corresponding state.
    </dt>
    <dd>
      The default value if the attribute is not specified.
    </dd>

    <dt>
      The "<dfn attr-value for="form/enctype"><code>multipart/form-data</code></dfn>"
      keyword and corresponding state.
    </dt>
    <dd>
      Allows for entire files to be submitted along with form data.

    <dt>
      The "<dfn attr-value for="form/enctype"><code>text/plain</code></dfn>"
      keyword and corresponding state.
    </dt>
    <dd>
      Submits as <a>plain text form data</a>, which is meant to be human readable.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  The <i>invalid value default</i> for these attributes is the
  <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> state. The <i>missing value default</i> for the
  <{form/enctype}> attribute is also the <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> state.
  (There is no <i>missing value default</i> for the
  <{submitbuttonelements/formenctype}> attribute.)

  The <dfn>enctype</dfn> of an element is one of those three states.
  If the element is a <{input/Submit|Submit Button}> and has a
  <{submitbuttonelements/formenctype}> attribute, then the element's <a>enctype</a> is that
  attribute's state; otherwise, it is the <a>form owner</a>'s <{form/enctype}> attribute's state.

  <hr />

  The <dfn element-attr for="form"><code>target</code></dfn> and
  <dfn element-attr for="submitbuttonelements,input,button"><code>formtarget</code></dfn> content
  attributes, if specified, must have values that are
  <a>valid browsing context names or keywords</a>.

  The <{form/target}> of an element is the value of the element's
  <{submitbuttonelements/formtarget}> attribute, if the element is a <{input/Submit|Submit Button}> and has such an attribute; or the value of its
  <a>form owner</a>'s <{form/target}> attribute, if <em>it</em> has
  such an attribute; or, if the {{Document}} contains a <{base}> element with a
  <{form/target}> attribute, then the value of the <{form/target}> attribute of the first such <{base}> element; or,

  <hr />

  The <dfn element-attr for="form"><code>novalidate</code></dfn> and
  <dfn element-attr for="submitbuttonelements,input,button"><code>formnovalidate</code></dfn> content attributes are <a>boolean attributes</a>. If present, they indicate that the form is
  not to be validated during submission.

  The <dfn>no-validate state</dfn> of an element is true if the

  <a>form owner</a>'s <{form/novalidate}> attribute is present,

  <div class="example">
    This attribute is useful to include "save" buttons on forms that have validation constraints,

  The <dfn element-attr for="formelements,input,button,select,textarea"><code>autofocus</code></dfn> content attribute allows the
  author to indicate that a control is to be focused as soon as the page is loaded or as soon as the

  <div class="note">
  When navigating to a fragment of a page, such as https://tink.uk#main, the fragment identifier takes precedence and the <{formelements/autofocus}> attribute has no effect.
  </div>

 <div  class="warning">
  <p>Use of the <{formelements/autofocus}> attribute can reduce usability and accessibility
  for users. Users of assistive technology can be adversively affected, because its use overrides
  the default behaviour of assistive technology to display content at the top of a document in the
  viewport, or announce content from the start of the document. Users with cognitive disabilities can
  also be disorientated by unexpected focus movement upon page load.</p>

  <p>User agents should provide a method for users to disable the <{formelements/autofocus}> attribute behaviour.</p>
  </div>

  The <{formelements/autofocus}> attribute is a <a>boolean attribute</a>.

  An element's <dfn>nearest ancestor autofocus scoping <a>document element</a></dfn> is the element itself

  There must not be two elements with the same
  <a>nearest ancestor autofocus scoping document element</a> that both have the
  <{formelements/autofocus}> attribute specified.

  When an element with the <{formelements/autofocus}> attribute specified
  is <a for="document">inserted into a document</a>, user agents
  should run the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>target</var> be the element's <a>node document</a>.</li>

    <li>If <var>target</var> has no <a>browsing context</a>, abort these steps.</li>

    <li>If <var>target</var>'s <a>browsing context</a> has no
    <a>top-level browsing context</a> (e.g., it is a <a>nested browsing context</a>
    with no <a>parent browsing context</a>), abort these steps.</li>

    <li>If <var>target</var>'s <a>active sandboxing flag set</a> has the
    <a>sandboxed automatic features browsing context flag</a>, abort these steps.</li>

    <li>If <var>target</var>'s [=concept/origin=] is not the same as the [=concept/origin=] of the

    <a>top-level browsing context</a>, abort these steps.</li>

    <li>If <var>target</var>'s [=concept/origin=] is not the same as the
    [=concept/origin=] of the <a>active document</a> of <var>target</var>'s
    <a>top-level browsing context</a>, abort these steps.</li>

    <li>If the user agent has already reached the last step of this list of steps in response to
    an element being <a>inserted</a> into a <code>Document</code> whose
    <a>top-level browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a> is the same as <var>target</var>'s
    <a>top-level browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a>, abort these steps.</li>

    <li>If the user has indicated (for example, by starting to type in a form control) that they
    do not wish focus to be changed, then optionally abort these steps.</li>

    <li><a>Queue a task</a> that runs the <a>focusing steps</a> for the element. User agents may
    also change the scrolling position of the document, or perform some other action that
    brings the element to the user's attention. The <a>task source</a> for this task is the
    <a>user interaction task source</a>.</li>

  </ol>

  <p class="note">
    This handles the automatic focusing during document load. The <code>show()</code> and
    <code>showModal()</code> methods of <{dialog}> elements also processes the

  <p class="note">
    Focusing the control does not imply that the user agent must focus the browser

  to the user agent how to, or indeed whether to, provide such a feature.

  <p class="warning">
    When fields with the <{autocompleteelements/autocomplete}> attribute are hidden off-screen or

    User agents should verify that all fields with the <{autocompleteelements/autocomplete}>

  The <dfn>autofill field</dfn> keywords relate to each other as described in the table below.
  Each field name listed on a row of this table corresponds to the meaning given in the cell for
  that row in the column labeled "Meaning". Some fields correspond to subparts of other fields;
  for example, a credit card expiry date can be expressed as one field giving both the month and
  year of expiry ("<code>cc-exp</code>"), or as two fields, one giving the month
  ("<code>cc-exp-month</code>") and one the year ("<code>cc-exp-year</code>"). In such cases, the
  names of the broader fields cover multiple rows, in which the narrower fields are defined.

  <p class="note">
    Generally, authors are encouraged to use the broader fields rather than the narrower fields,
    as the narrower fields tend to expose Western biases. For example, while it is common in some
    Western cultures to have a given name and a family name, in that order (and thus often
    referred to as a <i>first name</i> and a <i>surname</i>), many cultures put the family name
    first and the given name second, and many others simply have one name (a <i>mononym</i>).
    Having a single field is therefore more flexible.
  </p>

  Some fields are only appropriate for certain form controls.
  An <a>autofill field</a> name is
  <dfn lt="inappropriate for the control|inappropriate for a control">inappropriate for a control</dfn>
  if the control does not belong to the group listed for that <a>autofill field</a> in the fifth
  column of the first row describing that <a>autofill field</a> in the table below. What controls
  fall into each group is described below the table.

  <dfn lt="administrative level|second administrative level|third administrative level">Address levels</dfn>: The "<code>address-level1</code>" – "<code>address-level4</code>" fields are used to describe
  the locality of the street address. Different locales have different numbers of levels. For
  example, the US uses two levels (state and town), the UK uses one or two depending on the address
  (the post town, and in some cases the locality), and China can use three (province, city,
  district). The "<code>address-level1</code>" field
  represents the widest administrative division. Different locales order the fields in different
  ways; for example, in the US the town (level 2) precedes the state (level 1); while in Japan the
  prefecture (level 1) precedes the city (level 2) which precedes the district (level 3). Authors
  are encouraged to provide forms that are presented in a way that matches the country's conventions
  (hiding, showing, and rearranging fields accordingly as the user changes the country).

<h6 id="autofill-processing-model">Processing model</h6>

  Each <{input}> element to which the <{autocompleteelements/autocomplete}> attribute <a>applies</a>, each <{select}> element, and each <{textarea}> element, has an
  <dfn>autofill hint set</dfn>, an <dfn>autofill scope</dfn>, an <dfn>autofill field name</dfn>, and
  an <dfn>IDL-exposed autofill value</dfn>.

  The <a>autofill field name</a> specifies the specific kind of data expected in the field,
  e.g., "<code>street-address</code>" or "<code>cc-exp</code>".

  The <a>autofill hint set</a> identifies what address or contact information type the user
  agent is to look at, e.g., "<code>shipping</code> <code>fax</code>" or "<code>billing</code>".

  The <a>autofill scope</a> identifies the group of fields that are to be filled with the
  information from the same source, and consists of the <a>autofill hint set</a> with, if
  applicable, the "<code>section-*</code>" prefix, e.g., "<code>billing</code>", "<code>section-parent shipping</code>", or "<code>section-child
  shipping home</code>".

  These values are defined as the result of running the following algorithm:

  <ol>

    <li>If the element has no <{autocompleteelements/autocomplete}> attribute,
    then jump to the step labeled <i>default</i>.</li>

    <li>Let <var>tokens</var> be the result of <a lt="split a string on spaces">splitting the attribute's value on spaces</a>.</li>

    <li>If <var>tokens</var> is empty, then jump to the step labeled <i>default</i>.</li>

    <li>Let <var>index</var> be the index of the last token in <var>tokens</var>.</li>

    <li>

    If the <var>index</var>th token in <var>tokens</var> is not an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a>
    match for one of the tokens given in the first column of the following table, or if the number
    of tokens in <var>tokens</var> is greater than the maximum number given in the cell in the
    second column of that token's row, then jump to the step labeled <i>default</i>. Otherwise, let
    <var>field</var> be the string given in the cell of the first column of the matching row, and
    let <var>category</var> be the value of the cell in the third column of that same row.

  For the purposes of autofill, a <dfn>control's data</dfn> depends on the kind of control:

  </dl>

  <hr />

  How to process the <a>autofill hint set</a>, <a>autofill scope</a>,
  and <a>autofill field name</a> depends on the value of the
  <{autocompleteelements/autocomplete}> attribute.

  <dl class="switch">

    <dt>When <a>autofill field name</a> is "off"...</dt>

    <dd>
      When an element's <a>autofill field name</a> is
      "<a attr-value for="forms/autocomplete"><code>off</code></a>", the user agent should not

      <div class="example">
        Banks frequently do not want user agents to prefill login information:

        <xmp highlight="html">
          <div>
            <label>
              Account:

      When <a>autofill field name</a> is <em>not</em> "off"...
    </dt>
    <dd>
      When an element's <a>autofill field name</a> is <em>not</em>
      "<a attr-value for="forms/autocomplete"><code>off</code></a>", the user agent may store
      the <a>control's data</a>, and may offer previously stored values to the user.

      <div class="example">
        For example, suppose a user visits a page with this control:

        <xmp highlight="html">
          <select name="country">
            <option>Afghanistan</option>
            <option>Albania</option>
            <option>Algeria</option>
            <option>Andorra</option>
            <option>Angola</option>
            <option>Antigua and Barbuda</option>
            <option>Argentina</option>
            <option>Armenia</option>
            <!-- ... -->
            <option>Yemen</option>
            <option>Zambia</option>
            <option>Zimbabwe</option>
          </select>
        </xmp>

        This might render as follows:

        <img src="images/select-country-1.png" alt="A drop-down control with a long alphabetical list of countries." />

        Suppose that on the first visit to this page, the user selects "Zambia". On the second
        visit, the user agent could duplicate the entry for Zambia at the top of the list, so
        that the interface instead looks like this:

        <img src="images/select-country-2.png" alt="The same drop-down control with the alphabetical list of countries, but with Zambia as an entry at the top." />

      </div>

      When the <a>autofill field name</a> is "<code>on</code>", the user agent should attempt to
      use heuristics to determine the most appropriate values to offer the user, e.g., based on
      the element's <{formelements/name}> value, the position of the element in the document's
      DOM, what other fields exist in the form, and so forth.

      When the <a>autofill field name</a> is one of the names of the <a>autofill fields</a>
      described above, the user agent should provide suggestions that match the meaning of the
      field name as given in the table earlier in this section. The <a>autofill hint set</a>
      should be  used to select amongst multiple possible suggestions.

      <p class="example">
        For example, if a user once entered one address into fields that used the
        "<code>shipping</code>" keyword, and another address into fields that used the
        "<code>billing</code>" keyword, then in subsequent forms only the first address would be
        suggested for form controls whose <a>autofill hint set</a> contains the keyword
        "<code>shipping</code>". Both addresses might be suggested, however, for address-related
        form controls whose <a>autofill hint set</a> does not contain either keyword.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>When not the empty string...</dt>
    <dd>
      When the <a>autofill field name</a> is not the empty string, then the user agent must
      act as if the user had specified the <a>control's data</a> for the given
      <a>autofill hint set</a>, <a>autofill scope</a>, and <a>autofill field name</a> combination.
    </dd>

  </dl>

  When the user agent <dfn lt="derived from country in some cases|autofills form controls">autofills form controls</dfn>, elements
  with the same <a>form owner</a> and the same <a>autofill scope</a> must use data
  relating to the same person, address, payment instrument, and contact details. When a user agent autofills "<code>country</code>" and "<code>country-name</code>" fields with the same <a>form
  owner</a> and <a>autofill scope</a>, and the user agent has a value for the <code>country</code>" field(s), then the "<code>country-name</code>" field(s) must be filled using a
  human-readable name for the same country. When a user agent fills in multiple fields at
  once, all fields with the same <a>autofill field name</a>, <a>form owner</a> and
  <a>autofill scope</a> must be filled with the same value.

  <p class="example">
    Suppose a user agent knows of two phone numbers, +1 555 123 1234 and +1 555 666 7777. It would
    not be conforming for the user agent to fill a field with
    <code>autocomplete="shipping tel-local-prefix"</code> with the value "123" and another field in
    the same form with <code>autocomplete="shipping tel-local-suffix"</code> with the value "7777".
    The only valid prefilled values given the aforementioned information would be "123" and "1234",
    or "666" and "7777", respectively.</p>

  <p class="example">
    Similarly, if a form for some reason contained both a "<code>cc-exp</code>" field and a
    "<code>cc-exp-month</code>" field, and the user agent prefilled the form, then the month
    component of the former would have to match the latter.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    Consider the following markup snippet:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <form>
        <input type="hidden" autocomplete="nickname" value="TreePlate">
        <input type="text" autocomplete="nickname">
      </form>
    </xmp>

    The only value that a conforming user agent could suggest in the text field is
    "TreePlate", the value given by the hidden <{input}> element.

  </div>

  The "<code>section-*</code>" tokens in the <a>autofill scope</a> are opaque;
  user agents must not attempt to derive meaning from the precise values of these tokens.

  <p class="example">For example, it would not be conforming if the user agent decided that it
  should offer the address it knows to be the user's daughter's address for "<code>section-child</code>" and the addresses it knows to be the user's spouses' addresses for
  "<code>section-spouse</code>".</p>

  The autocompletion mechanism must be implemented by the user agent acting as if the user had
  modified the <a>control's data</a>, and must be done at a time where the element is <a>mutable</a> (e.g., just after the element has been <a for="document">inserted into the document</a>, or when the user agent [=stop parsing|stops parsing=]). User agents
  must only prefill controls using values that the user could have entered.

  <p class="example">For example, if a <{select}> element only has <{option}>
  elements with values "Steve" and "Rebecca", "Jay", and "Bob", and has an <a>autofill field
  name</a> "<code>given-name</code>", but the user
  agent's only idea for what to prefill the field with is "Evan", then the user agent cannot prefill
  the field. It would not be conforming to somehow set the <{select}> element to the value
  "Evan", since the user could not have done so themselves.</p>

  A user agent prefilling a form control's <a for="forms">value</a> must not
  cause that control to <a>suffer from a type
  mismatch</a>, <a>suffer from being too long</a>,
  <a>suffer from being too short</a>, <a>suffer from an underflow</a>, <a>suffer from an overflow</a>,
  <a>suffer from a step mismatch</a>, or <a>suffer from a pattern mismatch</a>. Where
  possible given the control's constraints, user agents must use the format given as canonical in
  the aforementioned table. Where it's not possible for the canonical format to be used, user agents
  should use heuristics to attempt to convert values so that they can be used.

  <div class="example">
    For example, if the user agent knows that the user's middle name is "Ines", and attempts to
    prefill a form control that looks like this:

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <input name="middle-initial" maxlength="1" autocomplete="additional-name">
    </xmp>

    ...then the user agent could convert "Ines" to "I" and prefill it that way.

  </div>

  <div class="example">
    A more elaborate example would be with month values. If the user agent knows that the user's
    birthday is the 27th of July 2012, then it might try to prefill all of the following controls
    with slightly different values, all driven from this information:

    <table>
    <tbody><tr>
      <td>
      <xmp highlight="html">
        <input name="b" type="month" autocomplete="bday">
      </xmp>
      </td><td>
      2012-07
      </td><td>
      The day is dropped since the <a>Month</a> state only accepts a
      month/year combination. (Note that this example is non-conforming, because the <span>autofill
      field name</span> <code data-x="attr-fe-autocomplete-bday">bday</code> is not allowed with the
      <span data-x="attr-input-type-month">Month</span> state.)
    </td></tr><tr>
      <td>
      <xmp highlight="html">
        <select name="c" autocomplete="bday">

        </select>
      </xmp>
      </td><td>
      July
      </td><td>
      The user agent picks the month from the listed options, either by noticing there are twelve
      options and picking the 7th, or by recognizing that one of the strings (three characters "Jul"
      followed by a newline and a space) is a close match for the name of the month (July) in one of
      the user agent's supported languages, or through some other similar mechanism.

  A user agent may allow the user to override an element's <a>autofill field name</a>, e.g.,
  to change it from "<code>off</code>" to "<code>on</code>" to allow values to be remembered and prefilled despite
  the page author's objections, or to always "<code>off</code>",
  never remembering values.

  More specifically, user agents may in particular consider replacing the <a>autofill field
  name</a> of form controls that match the description given in the first column of the following
  table, when their <a>autofill field name</a> is either "<code>on</code>" or "<code>off</code>", with the value given in the second cell of that
  row. If this table is used, the replacements must be done in <a>tree order</a>, since all
  but the first row references the <a>autofill field name</a> of earlier elements. When the
  descriptions below refer to form controls being preceded or followed by others, they mean in the
  list of <a>listed elements</a> that share the same <a>form owner</a>.

  The
  <dfn attribute for="HTMLInputElement,HTMLSelectElement,HTMLTextAreaElement"><code>autocomplete</code></dfn>
  IDL attribute, on getting,
  must return the element's <a>IDL-exposed autofill value</a>, and on setting, must
  <a>reflect</a> the content attribute of the same name.

<h4 id="apis-for-the-text-field-selections">APIs for text field selections</h4>

  The <{input}> and <{textarea}> elements define the following members in their
  DOM interfaces for handling their selection: {{HTMLInputElement/select()}},
  {{HTMLInputElement/selectionStart}}, {{HTMLInputElement/selectionEnd}},
  {{HTMLInputElement/selectionDirection}}, {{HTMLInputElement/setRangeText(replacement)}},
  {{HTMLInputElement/setSelectionRange(start, end)}}

  The {{HTMLInputElement/setRangeText()}} method uses the following enumeration:

  <pre class="idl" data-highlight="webidl">
    enum SelectionMode {
      "select",
      "start",
      "end",
      "preserve" // default
    };
  </pre>

  These methods and attributes expose and control the selection of <{input}> and
  <{textarea}> text fields.

  <dl class="domintro">

    <dt><var>element</var> . {{selectionapielements/select()}}</dt>

    <dd>

    Selects everything in the text field.

    </dd>

    <dt><var>element</var> . {{selectionapielements/selectionStart}} [ = <var>value</var> ]</dt>

    <dd>

    Returns the offset to the start of the selection.

    Can be set, to change the start of the selection.

    </dd>

    <dt><var>element</var> . {{selectionapielements/selectionEnd}} [ = <var>value</var> ]</dt>

    <dd>

    Returns the offset to the end of the selection.

    Can be set, to change the end of the selection.

    </dd>

    <dt><var>element</var> . {{selectionapielements/selectionDirection}} [ = <var>value</var> ]</dt>

    <dd>

    Returns the current direction of the selection.

    Can be set, to change the direction of the selection.

    The possible values are "<code>forward</code>", "<code>backward</code>", and "<code>none</code>".

    </dd>

    <dt><var>element</var> . setSelectionRange(<var>start</var>, <var>end</var> [, <var>direction</var>] )</dt>

    <dd>

    Changes the selection to cover the given substring in the given direction. If the direction
    is omitted, it will be reset to be the platform default (none or forward).

    </dd>

    <dt><var>element</var> . setRangeText(<var>replacement</var> [, <var>start</var>, <var>end</var> [, <var>selectionMode</var> ] ] )</dt>

    <dd>

    Replaces a range of text with the new text. If the <var>start</var> and <var>end</var> arguments are not provided, the range is assumed to be the selection.

    The final argument determines how the selection should be set after the text has been
    replaced. The possible values are:

    : "<code>select</code>"
    :: Selects the newly inserted text.
    : "<code>start</code>"
    :: Moves the selection to just before the inserted text.
    : "<code>end</code>"
    :: Moves the selection to just after the selected text.
    : "<code>preserve</code>"
    :: Attempts to preserve the selection. This is the default.

    </dd>

  </dl>

  For <{input}> elements, calling these methods while they <a>don't apply</a>, and getting or setting these attributes while they <a>don't apply</a>, must throw an {{InvalidStateError}} exception. Otherwise, they
  must act as described below.

  For <{input}> elements, these methods and attributes must operate on the element's
  <a for="forms">value</a>. For <{textarea}> elements, these methods and
  attributes must operate on the element's <a>raw value</a>.

  Where possible, user interface features for changing the text selection in <{input}>
  and <{textarea}> elements must be implemented in terms of the DOM API described in this
  section, so that, e.g., all the same events fire.

  The selections of <{input}> and <{textarea}> elements have a
  <i>direction</i>, which is either <i>forward</i>, <i>backward</i>, or <i>none</i>. This direction
  is set when the user manipulates the selection. The exact meaning of the selection direction
  depends on the platform.

  <p class="note">
    On Windows, the direction indicates the position of the caret relative to the
  selection: a <i>forward</i> selection has the caret at the end of the selection and a
  <i>backward</i> selection has the caret at the start of the selection. Windows has no <i>none</i>
  direction. On Mac, the direction indicates which end of the selection is affected when the user
  adjusts the size of the selection using the arrow keys with the Shift modifier: the forward
  direction means the end of the selection is modified, and the backwards direction means the start
  of the selection is modified. The none direction is the default on Mac, it indicates that no
  particular direction has yet been selected. The user sets the direction implicitly when first
  adjusting the selection, based on which directional arrow key was used.
  </p>

  The
  <dfn method for="selectionapielements,HTMLInputElement,HTMLTextAreaElement"><code>select()</code></dfn>
  method must cause the
  contents of the text field to be fully selected, with the selection direction being none, if the
  platform support selections with the direction <i>none</i>, or otherwise <i>forward</i>. The user
  agent must then <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> that bubbles named
  <code>select</code> at the element, using the <a>user interaction task
  source</a> as the task source.

  In the case of <{input}> elements, if the control has no text field, then the method
  must do nothing.

  <p class="example">For instance, in a user agent where <code highlight="html">&lt;input type="color"&gt;</code> is rendered as a color well with a
  picker, as opposed to a text field accepting a hexadecimal color code, there would be no text
  field, and thus nothing to select, and thus calls to the method are ignored.</p>

  The
  <dfn attribute for="selectionapielements,HTMLInputElement,HTMLTextAreaElement"><code>selectionStart</code></dfn>
  attribute
  must, on getting, return the offset (in logical order) to the character that immediately follows
  the start of the selection. If there is no selection, then it must return the offset (in logical
  order) to the character that immediately follows the text entry cursor.

  On setting, it must act as if the {{selectionapielements/setSelectionRange()}} method had been called,
  with the new value as the first argument; the current value of the {{selectionapielements/selectionEnd}} attribute as the second argument,
  unless the current value of the {{selectionapielements/selectionEnd}}
  is less than the new value, in which case the second argument must also be the new value; and the
  current value of the {{selectionapielements/selectionDirection}}
  as the third argument.

  The
  <dfn attribute for="selectionapielements,HTMLInputElement,HTMLTextAreaElement"><code>selectionEnd</code></dfn>
  attribute
  must, on getting, return the offset (in logical order) to the character that immediately follows
  the end of the selection. If there is no selection, then it must return the offset (in logical
  order) to the character that immediately follows the text entry cursor.

  On setting, it must act as if the {{selectionapielements/setSelectionRange()}} method had been called,
  with the current value of the {{selectionapielements/selectionStart}} attribute as the first argument,
  the new value as the second argument, and the current value of the {{selectionapielements/selectionDirection}} as the third argument.

  The
  <dfn attribute for="selectionapielements,HTMLInputElement,HTMLTextAreaElement"><code>selectionDirection</code></dfn>
  attribute must, on getting, return the string corresponding to the current selection direction: if
  the direction is <i>forward</i>, "<code>forward</code>"; if the direction is
  <i>backward</i>, "<code>backward</code>"; and otherwise, "<code>none</code>".

  On setting, it must act as if the {{selectionapielements/setSelectionRange()}} method had been called,
  with the current value of the {{selectionapielements/selectionStart}} IDL attribute as the first argument,
  the current value of the {{selectionapielements/selectionEnd}} IDL
  attribute as the second argument, and the new value as the third argument.

  The
  <dfn method for="selectionapielements,HTMLInputElement,HTMLTextAreaElement" lt="setSelectionRange()|setSelectionRange(start, end)|setSelectionRange(start, end, direction)"><code>setSelectionRange(<var>start</var>, <var>end</var>, <var>direction</var>)</code></dfn>
  method
  must set the selection of the text field to the sequence of characters starting with the character
  at the <var>start</var>th position (in logical order) and ending with the character at
  the (<var>end</var>-1)th position. Arguments greater than the
  length of the value of the text field must be treated as pointing at the end of the text field. If
  <var>end</var> is less than or equal to <var>start</var> then the start of the
  selection and the end of the selection must both be placed immediately before the character with

  method must run the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>

    If the method has only one argument, then let <var>start</var> and <var>end</var> have the values of the {{selectionapielements/selectionStart}} IDL attribute and the {{selectionapielements/selectionEnd}} IDL attribute respectively.

    Otherwise, let <var>start</var>, <var>end</var> have the values of the
    second and third arguments respectively.

    </li>

    <li>If <var>start</var> is greater than <var>end</var>, then throw an
    {{IndexSizeError}} exception and abort these steps.</li>

    <li>If <var>start</var> is greater than the length of the value of the text field,
    then set it to the length of the value of the text field.</li>

    <li>If <var>end</var> is greater than the length of the value of the text field,
    then set it to the length of the value of the text field.</li>

    <li>Let <var>selection start</var> be the current value of the {{selectionapielements/selectionStart}} IDL attribute.</li>

    <li>Let <var>selection end</var> be the current value of the {{selectionapielements/selectionEnd}} IDL attribute.</li>

    <li>If <var>start</var> is less than <var>end</var>, delete the sequence of

    order) and ending with the character at the (<var>end</var>-1)th
    position.</li>

    <li>Insert the value of the first argument into the text of the value of the text field,
    immediately before the <var>start</var>th character.</li>

    <li>Let <var>new length</var> be the length of the value of the first argument.</li>

    <li>Let <var>new end</var> be the sum of <var>start</var> and <var>new length</var>.</li>

    <li>

    Run the appropriate set of substeps from the following list:

    <dl class="switch">

      <dt>If the fourth argument's value is "<dfn enum-value for="SelectionMode"><code>select</code></dfn>"</dt>

      <dd>

      Let <var>selection start</var> be <var>start</var>.

      Let <var>selection end</var> be <var>new end</var>.

      </dd>

      <dt>If the fourth argument's value is "<dfn enum-value for="SelectionMode"><code>start</code></dfn>"</dt>

      <dd>

      Let <var>selection start</var> and <var>selection end</var> be <var>start</var>.

      </dd>

      <dt>If the fourth argument's value is "<dfn enum-value for="SelectionMode"><code>end</code></dfn>"</dt>

      Let <var>selection start</var> and <var>selection end</var> be <var>new end</var>.

      </dd>

      <dt>If the fourth argument's value is "<dfn enum-value for="SelectionMode"><code>preserve</code></dfn>" (the default)</dt>

      <dd>

      <ol>

        <li>Let <var>old length</var> be <var>end</var> minus <var>start</var>.

        </li><li>Let <var>delta</var> be <var>new length</var> minus <var>old length</var>.

        </li><li>

        If <var>selection start</var> is greater than <var>end</var>, then
        increment it by <var>delta</var>. (If <var>delta</var> is negative, i.e.,
        the new text is shorter than the old text, then this will <em>decrease</em> the value of
        <var>selection start</var>.)

        Otherwise: if <var>selection start</var> is greater than <var>start</var>, then set it to <var>start</var>. (This snaps the start of the
        selection to the start of the new text if it was in the middle of the text that it
        replaced.)

        </li>

        <li>

        If <var>selection end</var> is greater than <var>end</var>, then
        increment it by <var>delta</var> in the same way.

        Otherwise: if <var>selection end</var> is greater than <var>start</var>, then set it to <var>new end</var>. (This snaps the end of the
        selection to the end of the new text if it was in the middle of the text that it
        replaced.)

        </li>

      </ol>

      </dd>

    </dl>

    </li>

    <li>

    Set the selection of the text field to the sequence of characters starting with the character
    at the <var>selection start</var>th position (in logical order) and ending with the
    character at the (<var>selection end</var>-1)th position. In user agents
    where there is no concept of an empty selection, this must set the cursor to be just before the
    character with offset <var>end</var>. The direction of the selection must be set to
    <i>forward</i> if the platform does not support selections with the direction <i>none</i>, and
    <i>none</i> otherwise.

    </li>

    <li><a>Queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> that bubbles named <code>select</code> at the element, using the <a>user interaction task
    source</a> as the task source.</li>

  </ol>

  All elements to which this API <a>applies</a> have either a
  selection or a text entry cursor position at all times (even for elements that are not <a>being
  rendered</a>). User agents should follow platform conventions to determine their initial
  state.

  Characters with no visible rendering, such as U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER, still count as
  characters. Thus, for instance, the selection can include just an invisible character, and the
  text insertion cursor can be placed to one side or another of such a character.

  <div class="example">
    To obtain the currently selected text, the following JavaScript suffices:

    <pre highlight="javascript">
var selectionText = control.value.substring(control.selectionStart, control.selectionEnd);
    </pre>

    ...where <var>control</var> is the <{input}> or <{textarea}>
    element.

  </div>

  <div class="example">
    To add some text at the start of a text control, while maintaining the text selection, the
    three attributes must be preserved:

    <pre highlight="javascript">
var oldStart = control.selectionStart;
var oldEnd = control.selectionEnd;
var oldDirection = control.selectionDirection;
var prefix = "https://";
control.value = prefix + control.value;
control.setSelectionRange(oldStart + prefix.length, oldEnd + prefix.length, oldDirection);
    </pre>

    ...where <var>control</var> is the <{input}> or <{textarea}>
    element.

  A <a>submittable element</a> is a <dfn lt="candidates for constraint validation|candidate for
  constraint validation">candidate for constraint validation</dfn> except when a condition has
  <dfn lt="barred from constraint validation|barring it from constraint validation">barred the element from constraint validation</dfn>.
  (For example, an <{input}> with the <{input/readonly}> attribute is
  <a>barred from constraint validation</a>.)

  An element can have a <dfn>custom validity error message</dfn> defined. Initially, an element
  must have its <a>custom validity error message</a> set to the empty string. When its value
  is not the empty string, the element is <a>suffering from a custom error</a>. It can be set
  using the {{HTMLInputElement/setCustomValidity()}} method. The user
  agent should use the <a>custom validity error message</a> when alerting the user to the
  problem with the control.

  An element can be constrained in various ways. The following is the list of <dfn>validity
  states</dfn> that a form control can be in, making the control invalid for the purposes of
  constraint validation. (The definitions below are non-normative; other parts of this specification
  define more precisely when each state applies or does not.)

  : <dfn lt="suffer from being missing|suffering from being missing">Suffering from being missing</dfn>
  :: When a control has no <a for="forms">value</a> but has a <code>required</code> attribute
     (<{input}> <{input/required}>, <{textarea}> <{textarea/required}>); or, in the case of an
     element in a <i>radio button group</i>, any of the other elements in the group has a
     <code>required</code> attribute; or, for <{select}> elements, none of the <{option}>
     elements have their <a state for="option">selectedness</a> set (<{select}>
     <{select/required}>).

  : <dfn lt="suffer from a type mismatch|suffering from a type mismatch">Suffering from a type mismatch</dfn>
  :: When a control that allows arbitrary user input has a <a for="forms">value</a> that is not in
     the correct syntax (<{input/E-mail}>,
     <{input/URL}>).

  : <dfn lt="suffer from a pattern mismatch|suffering from a pattern mismatch">Suffering from a pattern mismatch</dfn>
  :: When a control has a <a for="forms">value</a> that doesn't satisfy the <{input/pattern}>
     attribute.

  : <dfn lt="suffer from being too long|suffering from being too long">Suffering from being too long</dfn>
  :: When a control has a <a for="forms">value</a> that is too long for the
     <a>form control <code>maxlength</code> attribute</a> (<{input}> <{input/maxlength}>,
     <{textarea}> <{textarea/maxlength}>).

  : <dfn lt="suffer from being too short|suffering from being too short">Suffering from being too short</dfn>
  :: When a control has a <a for="forms">value</a> that is too short for the
     <a>form control <code>minlength</code> attribute</a> (<{input}> <{input/minlength}>,
     <{textarea}> <{textarea/minlength}>).

  : <dfn lt="suffer from an underflow|suffering from an underflow">Suffering from an underflow</dfn>
  :: When a control has a <a for="forms">value</a> that is not the empty string and is too low for
     the <{input/min}> attribute.

  : <dfn lt="suffer from an overflow|suffering from an overflow">Suffering from an overflow</dfn>
  :: When a control has a <a for="forms">value</a> that is not the empty string and is too high for
     the <{input/max}> attribute.

  : <dfn lt="suffer from a step mismatch|suffering from a step mismatch">Suffering from a step mismatch</dfn>
  :: When a control has a <a for="forms">value</a> that doesn't fit the rules given by the
     <{input/step}> attribute.

  : <dfn lt="suffer from bad input|suffering from bad input">Suffering from bad input</dfn>
  :: When a control has incomplete input and the user agent does not think the user ought to be
     able to submit the form in its current state.

  : <dfn lt="suffer from a custom error|suffering from a custom error">Suffering from a custom error</dfn>
  :: When a control's <a>custom validity error message</a> (as set by the element's
     {{HTMLInputElement/setCustomValidity()}} method) is not the empty string.

  <p class="note">
    An element can still suffer from these states even when the element is disabled; thus these states can be represented in the DOM even
  if validating the form during submission wouldn't indicate a problem to the user.
  </p>

  An element <dfn lt="satisfy its constraints|satisfies its constraints|satisfy their constraints">satisfies its constraints</dfn> if it is not suffering
  from any of the above <a>validity states</a>.

<h5 id="sec-constraint-validation">Constraint validation</h5>

  When the user agent is required to <dfn lt="statically validating the constraints|statically validate the constraints">statically validate the constraints</dfn> of
  <{form}> element <var>form</var>, it must run the following steps, which return
  either a <i>positive</i> result (all the controls in the form are valid) or a <i>negative</i>
  result (there are invalid controls) along with a (possibly empty) list of elements that are
  invalid and for which no script has claimed responsibility:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>controls</var> be a list of all the <a>submittable elements</a> whose <a>form owner</a> is <var>form</var>, in <a>tree order</a>.</li>

    <li>Let <var>invalid controls</var> be an initially empty list of elements.</li>

    <li>

    For each element <var>field</var> in <var>controls</var>, in <a>tree
    order</a>, run the following substeps:

    <ol>

      <li>If <var>field</var> is not a <a>candidate for constraint validation</a>,
      then move on to the next element.</li>

      <li>Otherwise, if <var>field</var> <a>satisfies its
      constraints</a>, then move on to the next element.</li>

      <li>Otherwise, add <var>field</var> to <var>invalid
      controls</var>.</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    <li>If <var>invalid controls</var> is empty, then return a <i>positive</i> result and
    abort these steps.</li>

    <li>Let <var>unhandled invalid controls</var> be an initially empty list of
    elements.</li>

    <li>

    For each element <var>field</var> in <var>invalid controls</var>, if any,
    in <a>tree order</a>, run the following substeps:

    <ol>

      <li><a>Fire a simple event</a> named <code>invalid</code> that
      is cancelable at <var>field</var>.</li>

      <li>If the event was not canceled, then add <var>field</var> to <var>unhandled invalid controls</var>.</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    <li>Return a <i>negative</i> result with the list of elements in the <var>unhandled
    invalid controls</var> list.</li>

  </ol>

  If a user agent is to <dfn>interactively validate the constraints</dfn> of <{form}>
  element <var>form</var>, then the user agent must run the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li><a>Statically validate the constraints</a> of <var>form</var>, and let
    <var>unhandled invalid controls</var> be the list of elements returned if the result was
    <i>negative</i>.</li>

    <li>If the result was <i>positive</i>, then return that result and abort these steps.</li>

    <li>Report the problems with the constraints of at least one of the elements given in
    <var>unhandled invalid controls</var> to the user. User agents may focus one of those elements in
    the process, by running the <a>focusing steps</a> for that element, and may change the
    scrolling position of the document, or perform some other action that brings the element to the
    user's attention. User agents may report more than one constraint violation. User agents may
    coalesce related constraint violation reports if appropriate (e.g., if multiple radio buttons in a
    <a>group</a> are marked as required, only one error need be
    reported). If one of the controls is not <a>being rendered</a> (e.g., it has the <{global/hidden}> attribute set) then user agents may report a script
    error.</li>

    <li>Return a <i>negative</i> result.</li>

  When the

  invoked, if the element is a <a>candidate for constraint validation</a> and does not

  without doing anything else.

  When the
  <dfn method for="HTMLInputElement,HTMLButtonElement,HTMLSelectElement,HTMLTextAreaElement,HTMLOutputElement,HTMLFieldSetElement"><code>reportValidity()</code></dfn>
  method is
  invoked, if the element is a <a>candidate for constraint validation</a> and does not <a>satisfy its constraints</a>, the user agent must: <a>fire a simple

  and if that event is not canceled, report the problems with the constraints of that element to the
  user; then, return false. Otherwise, it must only return true without doing anything else. When
  reporting the problem with the constraints to the user, the user agent may run the <a>focusing
  steps</a> for that element, and may change the scrolling position of the document, or perform
  some other action that brings the element to the user's attention. User agents may report more
  than one constraint violation, if the element suffers from multiple problems at once. If the
  element is not <a>being rendered</a>, then the user agent may, instead of notifying the
  user, report a script error.

  The
  <dfn attribute for="HTMLInputElement,HTMLButtonElement,HTMLSelectElement,HTMLTextAreaElement,HTMLOutputElement,HTMLFieldSetElement"><code>validationMessage</code></dfn>
  attribute must
  return the empty string if the element is not a <a>candidate for constraint validation</a>
  or if it is one but it <a>satisfies its constraints</a>; otherwise,
  it must return a suitably localized message that the user agent would show the user if this were
  the only form control with a validity constraint problem. If the user agent would not actually
  show a textual message in such a situation (e.g., it would show a graphical cue instead), then the
  attribute must return a suitably localized message that expresses (one or more of) the validity
  constraint(s) that the control does not satisfy. If the element is a <a>candidate for
  constraint validation</a> and is <a>suffering from a custom error</a>, then the
  <a>custom validity error message</a> should be present in the return value.

  Servers should not rely on client-side validation. Client-side validation can

<h4 id="forms-form-submission"><dfn lt="form submission|form submissions">Form submission</dfn></h4>

<h5 id="form-submission-introduction">Introduction</h5>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  When a form is submitted, the data in the form is converted into the structure specified by the
  <a>enctype</a>, and then sent to the destination specified by the
  <{form/action}> using the given <a for="forms">method</a>.

  For example, take the following form:

  <xmp highlight="html">
    <form action="/find" method="get">
      <input type="text" name="t">
      <input type="search" name="q">
      <input type="submit">
    </form>
  </xmp>

  If the user types in "cats" in the first field and "fur" in the second, and then submits
  the form, then the user agent will load <code>/find?t=cats&amp;q=fur</code>.

  On the other hand, consider this form:

  <xmp highlight="html">
    <form action="/find" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <input type="text" name="t">
      <input type="search" name="q">
      <input type="submit">
    </form>
  </xmp>

  Given the same user input, the result on submission is quite different: the user agent instead
  does an HTTP POST to the given URL, with as the entity body something like the following text:

  <pre>------kYFrd4jNJEgCervE
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="t"

cats
------kYFrd4jNJEgCervE
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="q"

fur
------kYFrd4jNJEgCervE--</pre>

<h5 id="implicit-submission">Implicit submission</h5>

  A <{form}> element's <dfn>default button</dfn> is the first <{input/Submit|Submit Button}> in
  <a>tree order</a> whose <a>form owner</a> is that <{form}> element.

  If the user agent supports letting the user submit a form implicitly (for example, on some
  platforms hitting the "enter" key while a text field is <a>focused</a> implicitly submits the form), then
  doing so for a form whose <a>default button</a> has a defined <a>activation
  behavior</a> must cause the user agent to <a>run synthetic click activation steps</a> on
  that <a>default button</a>.

  <p class="note">
    Consequently, if the <a>default button</a> is disabled, the form is not submitted when such an implicit
  submission mechanism is used. (A button has no <a>activation behavior</a> when
  disabled.)
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    There are pages on the Web that are only usable if there is a way to implicitly
  submit forms, so user agents are strongly encouraged to support this.
  </p>

  If the form has
  no <{input/Submit|Submit Button}>, then the implicit submission
  mechanism must do nothing if the form has more than one <i>field that blocks implicit
  submission</i>, and must <a>submit</a> the <{form}>
  element from the <{form}> element itself otherwise.

  For the purpose of the previous paragraph, an element is a <i>field that blocks implicit
  submission</i> of a <{form}> element if it is an <{input}> element whose
  <a>form owner</a> is that <{form}> element and whose <{input/type}> attribute is in one of the following states:
  <{input/Text}>,
  <{input/Search}>,
  <{input/URL}>,
  <{input/Telephone}>,
  <{input/E-mail}>,
  <{input/Password}>,
  <{input/LocalDateTime|Local Date and Time}>,
  <{input/Date}>,
  <{input/Month}>,
  <{input/Week}>,
  <{input/Time}>,
  <{input/Number}>

<h5 id="form-submission-algorithm">Form submission algorithm</h5>

  When a <{form}> element <var>form</var> is <dfn lt="submit|submitted|form submission algorithm">submitted</dfn> from an element <var>submitter</var>
  (typically a button), optionally with a <var>submitted from {{HTMLFormElement/submit()}} method</var> flag set, the user agent must run the
  following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>form document</var> be the <var>form</var>'s
    <a>node document</a>.</li>

    <li id="sandboxSubmitBlocked">If <var>form document</var> has no associated
    <a>browsing context</a> or its <a>active sandboxing flag set</a> has its
    <a>sandboxed forms browsing context flag</a> set, then abort these steps without doing
    anything.</li>

    <li>Let <var>form browsing context</var> be the <a>browsing context</a> of <var>form document</var>.</li>

    <li>If the <var>submitted from {{HTMLFormElement/submit()}}
    method</var> flag is not set, and the <var>submitter</var> element's <a>no-validate state</a> is false, then <a>interactively
    validate the constraints</a> of <var>form</var> and examine the result: if the result
    is negative (the constraint validation concluded that there were invalid fields and probably
    informed the user of this) then <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>invalid</code> at the <var>form</var> element and then abort these
    steps.</li>

    <li>If the <var>submitted from {{HTMLFormElement/submit()}}
    method</var> flag is not set, then <a>fire a simple event</a> that bubbles and is
    cancelable named <code>submit</code>, at <var>form</var>. If the
    event's default action is prevented (i.e., if the event is canceled) then abort these steps.
    Otherwise, continue (effectively the default action is to perform the submission).</li>

    <li>Let <var>form data set</var> be the result of <a>constructing the form data set</a> for <var>form</var> in the context of <var>submitter</var>.</li>

    <li>Let <var>action</var> be the <var>submitter</var> element's <{form/action}>.</li>

    <li>

    If <var>action</var> is the empty string, let <var>action</var> be
    the document's [=Document/URL=] of the <var>form document</var>.

    </li>

    <li><a>Parse</a> the [=url/URL=] <var>action</var>, relative to the <var>submitter</var> element's <a>node document</a>. If this fails,
    abort these steps.</li>

    <li>Let <var>parsed action</var> be the <a>resulting URL string</a>.</li>

    <li>Let <var>action components</var> be the <a>resulting URL record</a>.</li>

    <li>Let <var>scheme</var> be the [=url/scheme=] of
    the <a>resulting URL record</a>.</li>

    <li>Let <var>enctype</var> be the <var>submitter</var> element's <a>enctype</a>.</li>

    <li>Let <var>method</var> be the <var>submitter</var> element's <a for="forms">method</a>.</li>

    <li>Let <var>target</var> be the <var>submitter</var> element's <a>target</a>.</li>

    <li>If the user indicated a specific <a>browsing context</a> to use when submitting the
    form, then let <var>target browsing context</var> be that <a>browsing context</a>.
    Otherwise, apply <a>the rules for choosing a browsing context given a browsing context
    name</a> using <var>target</var> as the name and <var>form browsing
    context</var> as the context in which the algorithm is executed, and let <var>target
    browsing context</var> be the resulting <a>browsing context</a>.</li>

    <li>If <var>target browsing context</var> was created in the previous step, or,
    alternatively, if the <var>form document</var> has not yet <a>completely
    loaded</a> and the <var>submitted from {{HTMLFormElement/submit()}}
    method</var> flag is set, then let <var>replace</var> be true. Otherwise, let it be
    false.</li>

    <li>

    If the value of <var>method</var> is <a>dialog</a> then jump to the <a>submit
    dialog</a> steps.

    Otherwise, select the appropriate row in the table below based on the value of <var>scheme</var> as given by the first cell of each row. Then, select the appropriate cell
    on that row based on the value of <var>method</var> as given in the first cell of each

    If <var>scheme</var> is not one of those listed in this table, then the behavior is
    not defined by this specification. User agents should, in the absence of another specification
    defining this, act in a manner analogous to that defined in this specification for similar
    schemes.

    Each <{form}> element has a <dfn>planned navigation</dfn>, which is either null or a
    <a>task</a>; when the <{form}> is first created, its
    <a>planned navigation</a> must be set to null. In the behaviors described below, when the
    user agent is required to <dfn>plan to navigate</dfn> to a particular resource <var>destination</var>, it must run the following steps:

    <ol>

      <li>If the <{form}> has a non-null <a>planned navigation</a>, remove it from
      its <a>task queue</a>.</li>

      <li>

      Let the <{form}>'s <a>planned navigation</a> be a new <a>task</a> that consists of running the following steps:

      <ol>

        <li>Let the <{form}>'s <a>planned navigation</a> be null.</li>

        <li><a>Navigate</a> <var>target browsing context</var> to
        <var>destination</var>. If <var>replace</var> is true, then <var>target browsing
        context</var> must be navigated with <a>replacement enabled</a>.

      </li></ol>

      For the purposes of this task, <var>target browsing context</var> and <var>replace</var> are
      the variables that were set up when the overall <a>form submission algorithm</a> was run, with
      their values as they stood when this <a>planned navigation</a> was <a>queued</a>.

      </li>

      <li>

      <a>Queue a task</a> that is the <{form}>'s new
      <a>planned navigation</a>.

      The <a>task source</a> for this task is the <a>DOM manipulation task
      source</a>.

      </li>

    </ol>

    The behaviors are as follows:

        <a>UTF-8 percent encode</a> all the U+0025 PERCENT SIGN characters in the resulting
        string and replace the first occurrence of "<code>%%%%</code>" in <var>action</var>
        with the resulting doubly-escaped string. [[!URL]]

        Otherwise, if <var>action</var> contains the string "<code>%%</code>"
        (two U+0025 PERCENT SIGN characters in a row, but not four), then
        <a>UTF-8 percent encode</a> all characters in <var>data</var> that, if interpreted as US-ASCII, are
        not characters in the URL <a>default encode set</a>, and then, treating the result as a

        with the resulting escaped string. [[!URL]]

        <a>Plan to navigate</a> to the potentially modified <var>action</var> (which
        will be a <a scheme lt="data:"><code>data:</code> URL</a>).

        Replace occurrences of U+002B PLUS SIGN characters (+) in <var>headers</var> with

        Let <var>destination</var> consist of all the characters from the first character
        in <var>action</var> to the character immediately before the first U+003F QUESTION
        MARK character (?), if any, or the end of the string if there are none.

        If there isn't one, or if it does not have an <code>open</code>
        attribute, do nothing. Otherwise, proceed as follows:

        If <var>submitter</var> is an <{input}> element whose <{input/type}> attribute is in
        the <{input/Image|Image Button}> state, then let <var>result</var>

<h5 id="selecting-a-form-submission-encoding">Selecting a <a>form submission</a> encoding</h5>

  If the user agent is to

  it must run the following steps:

  1. Let <var>encoding</var> be the <a>document's character encoding</a>.
  2. If the <code>form</code> element has an <code>accept-charset</code> attribute, set
      <var>encoding</var> to the return value of running these substeps:
      1. Let <var>input</var> be the value of the <code>form</code> element's

      6. Return the first encoding in <var>candidate encodings</var>.
  3. Return the result of <a>getting an output encoding</a> from <var>encoding</var>.

<h5 id="urlencoded-form-data">URL-encoded form data</h5>

  See the WHATWG URL specification for details on <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. [[!URL]]

  The <dfn><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> encoding algorithm</dfn> is as follows:

  1. Let <var>encoding</var> be the result of <a>picking an encoding for the form</a>.
  2. Let <var>serialized</var> be the result of running the
      <a><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> serializer</a> given
      <var>form data set</var> and <var>encoding</var>.
  3. Return the result of <a>encoding</a> <var>serialized</var>.

<h5 id="multipart-form-data">Multipart form data</h5>

  The <dfn><code>multipart/form-data</code> encoding algorithm</dfn> is as follows:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>result</var> be the empty string.</li>

    <li>

    If the algorithm was invoked with an explicit character encoding, let the selected character
    encoding be that encoding. (This algorithm is used by other specifications, which provide an
    explicit character encoding to avoid the dependency on the <{form}> element described
    in the next paragraph.)

    Otherwise, if the <{form}> element has an <{form/accept-charset}> attribute, let the selected character
    encoding be the result of <a>picking an encoding for the form</a>.

    Otherwise, if the <{form}> element has no <{form/accept-charset}> attribute, but the <a>document's
    character encoding</a> is an <a>ASCII-compatible encoding</a>, then that is
    the selected character encoding.

    Otherwise, let the selected character encoding be UTF-8.

    </li>

    <li>Let <var>charset</var> be the name of the
    selected <a>character encoding</a>.</li>

    <li>

    For each entry in the <var>form data set</var>, perform these substeps:

    <ol>

      <li>If the entry's name is "<code>_charset_</code>" and its
      type is "<code>hidden</code>", replace its value with <var>charset</var>.</li>

      <li>For each character in the entry's name and value that cannot be expressed using the
      selected character encoding, replace the character by a string consisting of a U+0026 AMPERSAND
      character (&amp;), a U+0023 NUMBER SIGN character (#), one or more <a>ASCII digits</a>
      representing the Unicode code point of the character in base ten, and finally a U+003B
      SEMICOLON character (;).</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    <li>

    Encode the (now mutated) <var>form data set</var> using the rules described by RFC 7578,
    <cite>Returning Values from Forms: <code>multipart/form-data</code></cite>, and return
    the resulting byte stream. [[!RFC7578]]

    Each entry in the <var>form data set</var> is a <i>field</i>, the name of the entry is the
    <i>field name</i> and the value of the entry is the <i>field value</i>.

    The order of parts must be the same as the order of fields in the <var>form data set</var>.
    Multiple entries with the same name must be treated as distinct fields.

    The parts of the generated <code>multipart/form-data</code> resource that correspond to
    non-file fields must not have a <code>Content-Type</code> header specified. Their names and
    values must be encoded using the character encoding selected above.

    File names included in the generated <code>multipart/form-data</code> resource (as part of
    file fields) must use the character encoding selected above, though the precise name may be
    approximated if necessary (e.g., newlines could be removed from file names, quotes could be
    changed to "%22", and characters not expressible in the selected character encoding could be
    replaced by other characters).

    For each character in the entry's file name that cannot be expressed using the selected
    character encoding, replace the character by a string consisting of a U+0026 AMPERSAND
    character (&amp;), a U+0023 NUMBER SIGN character (#), one or more <span>ASCII digits</span>
    representing the code point of the character in base ten, and finally a U+003B SEMICOLON
    character (;).

    Field names and file names included in the generated <code>multipart/form-data</code>
    resource must undergo multipart parameter-value character replacement for syntactically
    significant characters: for each character in the parameter value that is U+0022 QUOTATION MARK
    ("), U+007F DELETE (␡) or any other control in the range U+0000-U+001F except U+001B
    ESCAPE (␛), replace the character by a string consisting of a U+0025 PERCENT SIGN character (%)
    and two <a>ASCII hex digits</a> representing the code point of the character in base sixteen,
    and replace each U+005C REVERSE SOLIDUS character (\) with two consecutive U+005C REVERSE
    SOLIDUS characters (\\). U+001B ESCAPE (␛) is preserved (passed through unquoted) for
    Web-compatible ISO-2022-JP.

    The boundary used by the user agent in generating the return value of this algorithm is the
    <dfn><code>multipart/form-data</code> boundary string</dfn>. (This value is used to generate the
    MIME type of the <a>form submission</a> payload generated by this algorithm.)

    </li>

  </ol>

  For details on how to interpret <code>multipart/form-data</code> payloads, see RFC 7578. [[!RFC7578]]

<h5><dfn>Plain text form data</dfn></h5>

  The <dfn><code>text/plain</code> encoding algorithm</dfn> is as follows:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>result</var> be the empty string.</li>

    <li>Let <var>encoding</var> be the result of <a>picking an encoding for the form</a>.

    <li>Let <var>charset</var> be the name of <var>encoding</var>.</li>

    <li>If the entry's name is "<code>_charset_</code>" and its type
    is "<code>hidden</code>", replace its value with <var>charset</var>.</li>

    <li>If the entry's type is "<code>file</code>", replace its value with the file's
    name only.</li>

    <li>

    For each entry in the <var>form data set</var>, perform these substeps:

    <ol>

      <li>Append the entry's name to <var>result</var>.</li>

      <li>Append a single U+003D EQUALS SIGN character (=) to <var>result</var>.</li>

      <li>Append the entry's value to <var>result</var>.</li>

      <li>Append a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character pair to <var>result</var>.</li>

    </ol>

    </li>

    <li>Return the result of <a>encoding</a> <var>result</var> using
    <var>encoding</var>.</li>

  </ol>

  Payloads using the <code>text/plain</code> format are intended to be human readable. They are
  not reliably interpretable by computer, as the format is ambiguous (for example, there is no way
  to distinguish a literal newline in a value from the newline at the end of the value).

<h4 id="resetting-a-form">Resetting a form</h4>

  When a <{form}> element <var>form</var> is <dfn>reset</dfn>, the user agent must <a>fire a simple event</a> named
  <code>reset</code>, that bubbles and is cancelable, at <var>form</var>, and then, if that event is not canceled, must invoke the <a>reset algorithm</a> of each <a>resettable element</a> whose <a>form owner</a> is <var>form</var>.

  When the <a>reset</a> algorithm is invoked by the <code>reset()</code> method, the <code>reset</code> event
  fired by the <a>reset</a> algorithm must not be <a>trusted</a>.

  Each <a>resettable element</a> defines its own <dfn>reset algorithm</dfn>. Changes made to form controls as part of
  these algorithms do not count as changes caused by the user (and thus, e.g., do not cause <code>input</code> events to fire).
