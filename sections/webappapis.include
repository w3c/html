<h4 id="scripting-introduction">Introduction</h4>

  Various mechanisms can cause author-provided executable code to run in the context of a
  document. These mechanisms include, but are probably not limited to:

  * Processing of <{script}> elements.
  * Navigating to <a><code>javascript:</code> URLs</a>.
  * Event handlers, whether registered through the DOM using <code>addEventListener()</code>, by
     explicit <a>event handler content attributes</a>, by <a>event handler IDL attributes</a>, or
     otherwise.
  * Processing of technologies like SVG that have their own scripting features.

<h4 id="enabling-and-disabling-scripting">Enabling and disabling scripting</h4>

  <dfn lt="scripting was enabled|scripting is enabled">Scripting is enabled</dfn> in a <a>browsing
  context</a> when all of the following conditions are true:

  * The user agent supports scripting.
  * The user has not disabled scripting for this <a>browsing context</a> at this time.
     (User agents may provide users with the option to disable scripting globally, or in a
     finer-grained manner, e.g. on a per-origin basis.)
  * The <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a>'s <a>active sandboxing flag set</a> does
     not have its <a>sandboxed scripts browsing context flag</a> set.

  <dfn>Scripting is disabled</dfn> in a <a>browsing context</a>
  when any of the above conditions are false (i.e., when scripting is not enabled).

  <hr />

  <dfn>Scripting is enabled for a <em>node</em></dfn> if the node's <a>node document</a> has a
  <a>browsing context</a>, and <a>scripting is enabled</a> in that <a>browsing context</a>.

  <dfn>Scripting is disabled for a node</dfn> if there is no such <a>browsing context</a>, or if
  <a>scripting is disabled</a> in that <a>browsing context</a>.

<h4 id="scripting-processing-model">Processing model</h4>

<h5 id="processing-model-definitions">Definitions</h5>

  A <dfn for="concept" lt="script|scripts|scripting">script</dfn> is one of two possible structures.
  All scripts have:

  : A <dfn>settings object</dfn>
  :: An <a>environment settings object</a>, containing various settings that are shared with other
      <a for="concept">scripts</a> in the same context.

  : A <dfn>Source text</dfn>
  :: A string containing a block of executable code to be evaluated as a JavaScript
      <a for="ecma">Script</a>.

  : A <dfn>record</dfn>
  :: Either a <a>Script Record</a>, for <a>classic scripts</a>; a <a>Source Text Module Record</a>, for <a>module scripts</a>; or null. 
     In the former two cases, it represents a parsed script;
     null represents a failure parsing.

  : A <dfn>parse error</dfn>
  :: A JavaScript value, which has meaning only if the <a>record</a> is
     null, indicating that the corresponding script source text could not be parsed.

  : An <dfn>error to rethrow</dfn>
  :: A JavaScript value representing an error that will prevent evaluation from succeeding. It
     will be re-thrown by any attempts to <a>run</a> the script.
     <p class="note">Since this exception value is provided by the JavaScript specification, we know
     that it is never null, so we use null to signal that no error has occurred.</p>

  : <dfn>Fetch options</dfn>
  :: A set of <a>script fetch options</a>, containing various options related to fetching this
     script or <a>module scripts</a> that it imports.

  : A <dfn>base URL</dfn>
  :: A base URL used for resolving module specifiers when <a>resolving a module specifier</a>. This
      will either be the URL from which the script was obtained, for external module scripts, or the
      <a>document base URL</a> of the containing document, for inline module scripts.

  A <dfn>classic script</dfn> additionally has:

  : A <dfn>muted errors</dfn> boolean
  :: A boolean which, if true, means that error information will not be provided for errors in this
      script (used to mute errors for cross-origin scripts, since that can leak private information).

  A <dfn>module script</dfn> is another type of <a>script</a>. It has no additional <a>items</a>.

  An <dfn>environment</dfn> is an object that identifies the settings of a
  current or potential execution environment. An <a>environment</a> has the following fields:

  : An <dfn>id</dfn>
  :: An opaque string that uniquely identifies the <a>environment</a>.

  : A <dfn>creation URL</dfn>
  :: A <a>URL record</a> that represents the location of the resource with which the
      <a>environment</a> is associated.
      <p class="note">In the case of an <a>environment settings object</a>, this URL might be
      distinct from the <a>environment settings object</a>'s <a>responsible document</a>'s <a for="/">URL</a>, due to mechanisms such as
      <code>history.pushState()</code>.</p>

  : A <a>target browsing context</a>
  :: Null or a <a>service worker</a> that <a>controls</a> the <a>environment</a>.

  : An <dfn>execution ready flag</dfn>
  :: A flag that indicates whether the environment setup is done. It is initially unset.

  <hr />

  An <dfn>environment settings object</dfn> specifies algorithms for obtaining the following:

  : A <dfn>realm execution context</dfn>
  :: A <a>JavaScript execution context</a> shared by all <{script}> elements that use this settings
      object, i.e. all scripts in a given <a>JavaScript realm</a>. When we <a>run a classic
      script</a> or <a>run a module script</a>, this execution context becomes the top of the
      <a>JavaScript execution context stack</a>, on top of which another execution context specific
      to the script in question is pushed. (This setup ensures <a>ParseScript</a> and
      </a>ModuleEvaluation</a> know which Realm to use.)

  : A <a>module map</a>
  :: Used when importing JavaScript modules.

  : A <dfn>responsible browsing context</dfn>
  :: A <a>browsing context</a> that is assigned responsibility for actions taken by the scripts that
      use this <a>environment settings object</a>.

      <p class="example">When a script creates and <a>navigates</a> a new <a>top-level browsing
      context</a>, the {{Window/opener}} attribute of the new <a>browsing context</a>'s {{Window}}
      object will be set to the <a>responsible browsing context</a>'s {{WindowProxy}} object.</p>
  : A <dfn>responsible event loop</dfn>
  :: An <a>event loop</a> that is used when it would not be immediately clear what event loop to
      use.

  : A <dfn>responsible document</dfn>
  :: A {{Document}} that is assigned responsibility for actions taken by the scripts that use this
      <a>environment settings object</a>.

      <p class="example">For example, the [=Document/URL=] of the <a>responsible document</a> is used
      to set the [=Document/URL=] of the {{Document}} after it has been reset using
      {{Document/open()}}.</p>

      If the <a>responsible event loop</a> is not a <a>browsing context</a> <a>event loop</a>, then
      the <a>environment settings object</a> has no <a>responsible document</a>.

  : An <dfn>API URL character encoding</dfn>
  :: A character encoding used to encode URLs by APIs called by scripts that use this
      <a>environment settings object</a>.

  : An <dfn>API base URL</dfn>
  :: An [=url/URL=] used by APIs called by scripts that use this
      <a>environment settings object</a> to <a lt="parse a URL">parse URLs</a>.

  : An <dfn for="security">origin</dfn>
  :: An [=concept/origin=] used in security checks.

  : An <dfn for="settings">HTTPS state</a>
  :: An <a>HTTPS state value</a> representing the security properties of the network channel used to
     deliver the resource with which the <a>environment settings object</a> is associated.

  : An <a>referrer policy</a>
  :: The default <a>referrer policy</a> for <a>fetches</a> performed using this
     <a>environment settings object</a> as a <dfn>request client</dfn>. [[!REFERRERPOLICY]]

  An <a>environment settings object</a> also has an
  <dfn>outstanding rejected promises weak set</dfn> and an
  <dfn>about-to-be-notified rejected promises list</dfn>, used to track
  <a>unhandled promise rejections</a>. The <a>outstanding rejected promises weak set</a> must not
  create strong references to any of its members, and implementations are free to limit its size,
  e.g., by removing old entries from it when new ones are added.

<h5 id="sec-fetching-scripts"><dfn>Fetching scripts</dfn></h5>

  <p>This section introduces a number of algorithms for fetching scripts, taking various necessary
  inputs and resulting in <a>classic scripts</a> or <a>module scripts</a>.</p>

  <hr />

  <p><dfn>Script fetch options</dfn> is a <a>struct</a> with the following <a>items</a>:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><dfn for="script">cryptographic nonce</dfn></dt>

   <dd><p>The <a>cryptographic nonce metadata</a> used
   for the initial fetch and for fetching any imported modules</p></dd>

   <dt><dfn for="script">integrity metadata</dfn></dt>

   <dd><p>The <a>integrity metadata</a> used for
   the initial fetch</dd>

   <dt><dfn for="script">parser metadata</dfn></dt>

   <dd><p>The <a>parser metadata</a> used for the
   initial fetch and for fetching any imported modules</p></dd>

   <dt><dfn for="script">credentials mode</dfn></dt>

   <dd><p>The <a>credentials mode</a> used for the
   initial fetch (for <a>module scripts</a>) and for fetching any
   imported modules (for both <a>module scripts</a> and <a>classic scripts</a>)</p></dd>

   <dt><dfn for="script">referrer policy</dfn></dt>

   <dd><p>The [[!REFERRER-POLICY#referrer policy]] used for the
   initial fetch and for fetching any imported modules</p></dd>
  </dl>

  <p class="note">Recall that via the <code>import()</code> feature, <a>classic scripts</a> can import <a>module scripts</a>.</p>

  
  <p>The <dfn>default classic script fetch options</dfn> are a set of <a>script fetch options</a>
  whose <a>cryptographic nonce</a> is the empty string, <a>integrity metadata</a> is the empty string, 
  <a>parser metadata</a> is "<code>not-parser-inserted</code>", <a>credentials mode</a> is "<code>omit</code>",
  and <a>referrer policy</a> is the empty string.</p>

  <p>Given a <a>request</a> <var>request</var> and <a>script fetch options</a> <var>options</var>, we define:</p>

  <dl>
   <dt><dfn>set up the classic script request</dfn></dt>
   <dd><p>Set <var>request</var>'s <a>cryptographic nonce metadata</a> to <var>options</var>'s <a>cryptographic nonce</a>, its <a>integrity metadata</a> to <var>options</var>'
   <a>integrity metadata</a>, its <a>parser metadata</a> to <var>options</var>'
   <a>parser metadata</a>, and its <a>referrer policy</a> to <var>options</var>' <a>referrer policy</a>.</p></dd>

   <dt><dfn>set up the module script request</dfn></dt>
   <dd><p>Set <var>request</var>'s <a>cryptographic nonce
   metadata</a> to <var>options</var>' <a>cryptographic nonce</a>, its <a>integrity metadata</a> to <var>options</var>'
   <a>integrity metadata</a>, its <a>parser metadata</a> to <var>options</var>'
   <a>parser metadata</a>, its <a>credentials mode</a> to <var>options</var>' <a>credentials mode</a>, 
   and its <a>referrer policy</a> to <var>options</var>' <a>referrer policy</a>.</p></dd>
  </dl>

  For any given <a>script fetch options</a> <var>options</var>, the <dfn>descendant script fetch options</dfn>
  are a new set of <a>script fetch options</a> whose <a>items</a> all have the same values,
  except for the <a>integrity metadata</a>, which is instead the empty string.

  <hr>

  The algorithms below can be customized by optionally supplying a custom <dfn for="fetching scripts">perform the  fetch</dfn> hook,
  which takes a <a>request</a> and an <dfn for="fetching scripts"><var>is top-level</var></dfn> flag. The algorithm must complete with a <a>response</a>
  (which may be a <a>network error</a>), either synchronously (when using <a>fetch a classic worker-imported script</a>) or asynchronously
  (otherwise). The <var>is top-level</var> flag will be set for all <a>classic script</a> fetches,
  and for the initial fetch when <a>fetching a module script tree</a> or <a>fetching a module worker script tree</a>,
  but not for the fetches resulting from <code>import</code> statements encountered throughout the graph.

  <div class="note">
   By default, not supplying the <a>perform the fetch</a> will cause the below algorithms to simply <a>fetch</a>
   the given <a>request</a>, with algorithm-specific customizations to the <a>request</a> and validations of the resulting <a>response</a>.

   To layer your own customizations on top of these algorithm-specific ones, supply a <a>perform the fetch</a> hook that modifies the given
   <a>request</a>, <a>fetches</a> it,
   and then performs specific validations of the resulting <a>response</a> (completing with a <a>network error</a> if the
   validations fail).

   The hook can also be used to perform more subtle customizations, such as keeping a cache of
   <a>responses</a> and avoiding performing a <a>fetch</a> at all.

  <p class="note">Service Workers is an example of a specification that runs these algorithms with
  its own options for the hooks. [[SERVICE-WORKERS]]</p>

  To <dfn lt="fetching a classic script|fetch a classic script">fetch a classic script</dfn>
  for a <{script}> element <var>element</var>, given a
  <var>url</var>, a <var>CORS setting</var>, a <var>settings object</var>, and some <var>options</var>, run
  these steps. The algorithm will asynchronously complete with either null (on failure) or a new
  <a>classic script</a> (on success).

  1. Let <var>request</var> be the result of <a>creating a potential-CORS request</a> given
      <var>url</var>, "<var>script</var>", and <var>CORS setting</var>.
  2. Set <var>request</var>'s <a>client</a> to <var>object</var>.
  3. <a>Set up the classic script request</a> given <var>request</var> and <var>options</var>.
  4. If the caller specified custom steps to <a>perform
      the fetch</a>, perform them on <var>request</var>, with the <var>is top-level</var> flag set. Return from this algorithm,
      and when the custom <a>perform the fetch</a> steps
      complete with <a>response</a> <var>response</var>, run the
      remaining steps.
      <p>Otherwise, <a>fetch</a> <var>request</var>.</p>
  5. Return from this algorithm, and run the remaining steps as part of the fetch's <a>process
      response</a> for the <a>response</a> <var>response</var>.

      <p class="note">
        <var>response</var> can be either <a>CORS-same-origin</a> or <a>CORS-cross-origin</a>. This
        only affects how error reporting happens.
      </p>
  6. If <var>response</var>'s <a for="response">type</a> is "<code>error</code>", or
      <var>response</var>'s <a>status</a> is not an <a>ok status</a>, asynchronously complete this
      algorithm with null, and abort these steps.
  7. If the caller specified custom steps to <a data-lt="process response">process the response</a>, perform them on
      <var>response</var>. If they return false, complete this algorithm with null, and abort these
      steps.
  8. If <var>response</var>'s <a>Content-Type metadata</a>, if any, specifies a character encoding,
      and the user agent supports that encoding, then set <var>character encoding</var> to that
      encoding (ignoring the passed-in value).
  9. Let <var>source text</var> be the result of <a>decoding</a> <var>response</var>'s
      [=response/body=] to Unicode, using <var>character encoding</var> as the fallback
      encoding.

      <p class="note">
        The <a>decode</a> algorithm overrides <var>character encoding</var> if the file contains a
        BOM.
      </p>
  10. Let <var>script</var> be the result of <a>creating a classic script</a> using <var>source
       text</var> and <var>settings object</var>.

       If <var>response</var> was <a>CORS-cross-origin</a>, then pass the <var>muted errors</var>
       flag to the <a>create a classic script</a> algorithm as well.
  11. Asynchronously complete this algorithm with <var>script</var>.

  To <dfn>fetch a classic worker script</dfn> given a <var>url</var>, a <var>fetch client settings object</var>,
  a <var>destination</var>, and a <var ignore=''>script settings object</var>, run these steps. The algorithm will
  asynchronously complete with either null (on failure) or a new <a>classic script</a>
  (on success).

  1. Let <var>request</var> be a new <a>request</a> whose <a for="/">url</a> is <var>url</var>, 
      <a>client</a> is <var>fetch client settings object</var>, <a>destination</a> is <var>destination</var>,
       <a>mode</a> is "<code>same-origin</code>", <a>credentials mode</a> is "<code>same-origin</code>",
       <a>parser metadata</a> is "<code>not parser-inserted</code>", and whose
       <a>use-URL-credentials flag</a> is set.
  2. If the caller specified custom steps to <a>perform the fetch</a>, perform them on <var>request</var>, with the <a>is top-level</a> flag set. 
      Return from this algorithm, and when the custom <a>perform the fetch</a> steps complete with <a>response</a> <var>response</var>,
      run the remaining steps.
      <p>Otherwise, <a>fetch</a> <var>request</var>.</p>
  4. Return from this algorithm, and run the remaining steps as part of the fetch's <a>process response</a>
      for the <a>response</a> <var>response</var>.
  5. If <var>response</var>'s <a for="response">type</a> is "<code>error</code>", or
      <var>response</var>'s <a>status</a> is not an <a>ok status</a>, asynchronously complete this
      algorithm with null, and abort these steps.
  6. If the caller specified custom steps to <a data-lt="process response">process the response</a>, perform them on
      <var>response</var>. If they return false, complete this algorithm with null, and abort these
      steps.
  7. Let <var>source text</var> be the result of <a>UTF-8 decoding</a> <var>response</var>'s
      [=response/body=].
  8. Let <var>script</var> be the result of <a>creating a classic script</a> using <var>source
      text</var> and <var>settings object</var>.
  9. Asynchronously complete this algorithm with <var>script</var>.

  To <dfn lt="fetching a module script tree|fetch a module script tree">fetch a module script tree</dfn>
  given a <var>url</var>, a <var>settings object</var>, a <var>destination</var>, and some
  <var>options</var>, run these
  steps. The algorithm will asynchronously complete with either null (on failure) or a new
  <a>module script</a> (on success).

  1. If <var>ancestor list</var> is not given, let it be an empty list.
  2. If <var>module map settings object</var> is not given, let it be <var>fetch client settings
      object</var>.
  3. <a>Fetch a single module script</a> given <var>url</var>, <var>credentials mode</var>,
      <var>cryptographic nonce</var>, <var ignore=''>parser state</var>, <var>destination</var>, and
      <var>module map settings object</var>. If the caller of this algorithm specified custom
      <a>set up the module script request</a> or <a data-lt="process response">process the response</a> steps, pass those along while
      <a>fetching a single module script</a>.
  4. Return from this algorithm and run the following steps when <a>fetching a single module
      script</a> asynchronously completes with <var>result</var>:
  5. If <var>result</var> is null, asynchronously complete this algorithm with null and abort these
      steps.
  6. Otherwise, <var>result</var> is a <a>module script</a>. <a>Fetch the descendants</a> of
      <var>result</var> given <var>destination</var> and an ancestor list obtained by appending
      <var>url</var> to <var>ancestor list</var>.
  7. When <a>fetching the descendants of a module script</a> asynchronously completes with
      <var>descendants result</var>, asynchronously complete this algorithm with <var>descendants
      result</var>.

  <hr />

  The following algorithms are used when <a>fetching a module script tree</a>, and are not meant to
  be used directly by other specifications (or by other parts of this specification).

  To <dfn lt="fetching the descendants of a module script|fetch the descendants of a module script|fetch the descendants">fetch the descendants of a module script</dfn>
  <var>module script</var>, given a
  <var>destination</var> and an <var>ancestor list</var>, run these steps. The algorithm will
  asynchronously complete with either null (on failure) or with <var>module script</var>
  (on success).

  1. Let <var>record</var> be <var>module script</var>'s <a>module record</a>.
  2. If <var>record</var>.\[[RequestedModules]] is empty, asynchronously complete this algorithm
      with <var>module script</var>.
  3. Let <var>urls</var> be a new empty list.
  4. For each string <var>requested</var> of <var>record</var>.\[[RequestedModules]]:
      1. Let <var>url</var> be the result of <a>resolving a module specifier</a> given
          <var>module script</var> and <var>requested</var>.
      2. If the result is error:
          1. Let <var>error</var> be a new {{TypeError}} exception.
          2. <a>Report the exception</a> <var>error</var> for <var>module script</var>.
          3. Abort this algorithm, and asynchronously complete it with null.
      3. Otherwise, if <var>url</var> is not in <var>ancestor list</var>, add <var>url</var> to
          <var>urls</var>.
  5. For each <var>url</var> in <var>urls</var>, <a>fetch a module script tree</a> given

      <var>module script</var>'s <a>cryptographic nonce</a>, <var>module script</var>'s
      <a>parser state</a>, <var>destination</var>, <var>module script</var>'s
      <a>settings object</a>, and <var>ancestor list</var>.

      <p class="note">It is intentional that no custom <a>set up the module script request</a> or <a data-lt="process response">process the response</a> steps are passed along here. Those hooks only apply to the top-level fetch at

      If any of the <a>fetch a module script tree</a> invocations asynchronously complete with
      null, the user agent may <a>terminate</a> any or all of the other fetches, and must then
      asynchronously complete this algorithm with null.

      Once all of the <a>fetch a module script tree</a> invocations asynchronously complete with a

  The algorithm will asynchronously complete with either null (on failure) or a <a>module script</a> (on success).

  1. Let <var>module map</var> be <var>settings object</var>'s <a>module map</a>.
  2. If <var>module map</var> contains an entry with key <var>url</var> whose value is
      "<code>fetching</code>", wait (<a>in parallel</a>) until that entry's value changes, then
      proceed to the next step.
  3. If <var>module map</var> contains an entry with key <var>url</var>, asynchronously complete
      this algorithm with that entry's value, and abort these steps.
  4. Create an entry in <var>module map</var> with key <var>url</var> and value
      "<code>fetching</code>".
  5. Let <var>request</var> be a new <a>request</a> whose

      <p class="note"><var>response</var> is always <a>CORS-same-origin</a>.</p>
  9. If any of the following conditions are met, set the value of the entry in

  <var>settings</var> are as follows. They return either "run" or "do not run".

  1. If the <a>global object</a> specified by <var>settings</var> is a {{Window}} object whose
      {{Document}} object is not <a>fully active</a>, then return "do not run" and abort these
      steps.
  2. If <a>scripting is disabled</a> for the <a>responsible browsing context</a> specified by
      <var>settings</var>, then return "do not run" and abort these steps.
  3. Return "run".

  The steps to <dfn>prepare to run script</dfn> with an <a>environment settings object</a>
  <var>settings</var> are as follows:

  1. Increment <var>settings</var>'s <a>realm execution context</a>'s <a>entrance counter</a> by
      one.
  2. Push <var>settings</var>'s <a>realm execution context</a> onto the <a>JavaScript execution
      context stack</a>; it is now the <a>running JavaScript execution context</a>.

  The steps to <dfn>clean up after running script</dfn> with an <a>environment settings object</a>
  <var>settings</var> are as follows:

  1. Assert: <var>settings</var>'s <a>realm execution context</a> is the <a>running JavaScript
      execution context</a>.
  2. Decrement <var>settings</var>'s <a>realm execution context</a>'s <a>entrance counter</a> by
      one.
  3. Remove <var>settings</var>'s <a>realm execution context</a> from the <a>JavaScript execution
      context stack</a>.
  4. If the <a>JavaScript execution context stack</a> is now empty, <a>run the global script
      clean-up jobs</a>. (These cannot run scripts.)
  5. If the <a>JavaScript execution context stack</a> is now empty, <a>perform a microtask
      checkpoint</a>. (If this runs scripts, these algorithms will be invoked reentrantly.)

  <p class="note">
  These algorithms are not invoked by one script directly calling another, but they
  can be invoked reentrantly in an indirect manner, e.g., if a script dispatches an event which has
  event listeners registered.
  </p>

  The <dfn>running script</dfn> is the script in the \[[HostDefined]] field in the ScriptOrModule
  component of the <a>running JavaScript execution context</a>.

  Each <a>unit of related similar-origin browsing contexts</a> has a <dfn>global script
  clean-up jobs list</dfn>, which must initially be empty. A global script clean-up job cannot run
  scripts, and cannot be sensitive to the order in which other clean-up jobs are executed. The File
  API uses this to release <a scheme><code>blob:</code></a> URLs. [[!FILEAPI]]

  When the user agent is to <dfn>run the global script clean-up jobs</dfn>, the user agent must
  perform each of the jobs in the <a>global script clean-up jobs list</a> and then empty the
  list.

<h5 id="realms-settings-objects-global-objects">Realms, settings objects, and global objects</h5>

  A <dfn>global object</dfn> is a JavaScript object that is the \[[GlobalObject]] field of a
  <a>JavaScript realm</a>.

  <p class="note">In this specification, all <a>JavaScript realms</a> are <a>initialized</a> with
  <a>global objects</a> that are either {{Window}} or {{WorkerGlobalScope}} objects.

  There is always a 1:1:1 mapping between <a>JavaScript realms</a>, <a>global objects</a>, and
  <a>environment settings objects</a>:

  * A <a>JavaScript realm</a> has a \[[HostDefined]] field, which contains <dfn>the Realm's settings
     object</dfn>.
  * A <a>JavaScript realm</a> has a \[[GlobalObject]] field, which contains <dfn>the Realm's global
     object</dfn>.
  * Each <a>global object</a> in this specification is created during the
     <a lt="InitializeHostDefinedRealm">initialization</a> of a corresponding
     <a>JavaScript realm</a>, known as <dfn>the global object's Realm</dfn>.
  * Each <a>global object</a> in this specification is created alongside a corresponding
     <a>environment settings object</a>, known as its <a>relevant settings object</a>.
  * An <a>environment settings object</a>'s <a>realm execution context</a>'s Realm component is
     <dfn>the environment settings object's Realm</dfn>.
  * An <a>environment settings object</a>'s <a>Realm</a> then has a \[[GlobalObject]] field, which
     contains <dfn>the environment settings object's global object</dfn>.

  When defining algorithm steps throughout this specification, it is often important to indicate
  what <a>JavaScript realm</a> is to be used—or, equivalently, what <a>global object</a> or
  <a>environment settings object</a> is to be used. In general, there are at least four
  possibilities:

  : <dfn>Entry</dfn>
  :: This corresponds to the script that initiated the currently running script action: i.e., the
      function or script that the user agent called into when it called into author code.

  : <dfn>Incumbent</dfn>
  :: This corresponds to the most-recently-entered author function or script on the stack.

  : <dfn>Current</dfn>
  :: This corresponds to the currently-running function object, including built-in user-agent
      functions which might not be implemented as JavaScript. (It is derived from the current
      <a>JavaScript realm</a>.)

  : <dfn>Relevant</dfn>
  :: Every <a>platform object</a> has a <a>relevant Realm</a>. When writing algorithms, the most
      prominent <a>platform object</a> whose <a>relevant Realm</a> might be important is the
      <code>this</code> value of the currently-running function object. In some cases, there can be
      other important <a>relevant Realms</a>, such as those of any arguments.

  Note how the <a>entry</a>, <a>incumbent</a>, and <a>current</a> concepts are usable without
  qualification, whereas the <a>relevant</a> concept must be applied to a particular
  <a>platform object</a>.

  <div class="example">
  Consider the following pages, with <code>a.html</code> being loaded in a browser window,
  <code>b.html</code> being loaded in an <{iframe}> as shown, and <code>c.html</code> and
  <code>d.html</code> omitted (they can simply be empty documents):

  <xmp highlight="html">
   <!-- a/a.html -->
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <title>Entry page</title>

   <iframe src="b.html"></iframe>
   <button onclick="frames[0].hello()">Hello</button>
  </xmp>

  <xmp highlight="html">
   <!-- b.html -->
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <title>Incumbent page</title>

   <iframe src="c.html" id="c"></iframe>
   <iframe src="d.html" id="d"></iframe>

   <script>
   const c = document.querySelector("#c").contentWindow;
   const d = document.querySelector("#d").contentWindow;

   window.hello = () => {
     c.print.call(d);
   };
   </script>
  </xmp>

  Each page has its own <a>browsing context</a>, and thus its own <a>JavaScript realm</a>,
  <a>global object</a>, and <a>environment settings object</a>.

  When the {{Window/print()}} method is called in response to pressing the button in
  <code>a.html</code>, then:

  * The <a>entry Realm</a> is that of <code>a.html</code>.
  * The <a>incumbent Realm</a> is that of <code>b.html</code>.
  * The <a>current Realm</a> is that of <code>c.html</code> (since it is the {{Window/print()}}
     method from <code>c.html</code> whose code is running).
  * The <a>relevant Realm</a> of the object on which the {{Window/print()}} method is being called
     is that of <code>d.html</code>.

  </div>

  <p class="warning">The <a>incumbent</a> and <a>entry</a> concepts should not be used by new
  specifications, and we are considering whether we can remove almost all existing uses</p>

  <p class="note">Currently, the <a>incumbent</a> concept is used in some security checks, and the
  <a>entry</a> concept is sometimes used to obtain, amongst other things, the <a>API base URL</a> to
  <a>parse a URL</a>, used in scripts running in that <a>unit of related similar-origin browsing
  contexts</a>.

  In general, the <a>current</a> concept is what should be used by specifications going forward.
  There is an important exception, however. If an algorithm is creating an object that is to be
  persisted and returned multiple times (instead of simply returned to author code right away, and
  never vended again), it should use the <a>relevant</a> concept with regard to the object on which
  the method in question is being executed. This prevents cross-realm calls from causing an object
  to store objects created in the "wrong" realm.

  <div class="example">
  The <code>navigator.getBattery()</code> method creates promises in the <a>relevant Realm</a> for
  the {{Navigator}} object on which it is invoked. This has the following impact: [[BATTERY-STATUS]]

  <xmp highlight="html">
  <!-- outer.html -->
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <title>Relevant Realm demo: outer page</title>
  <script>
    function doTest() {
      const promise = navigator.getBattery.call(frames[0].navigator);

      console.log(promise instanceof Promise);           // logs false
      console.log(promise instanceof frames[0].Promise); // logs true

      frames[0].hello();
    }
  </script>
  <iframe src="inner.html" onload="doTest()"></iframe>
  </xmp>

  <xmp highlight="html">
  <!-- inner.html -->
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <title>Relevant Realm demo: inner page</title>
  <script>
    function hello() {
      const promise = navigator.getBattery();

      console.log(promise instanceof Promise);        // logs true
      console.log(promise instanceof parent.Promise); // logs false
    }
  </script>
  </xmp>

  If the algorithm for the <code>getBattery()</code> method had instead used the <a>current
  Realm</a>, all the results would be reversed. That is, after the first call to
  <code>getBattery()</code> in <code>outer.html</code>, the {{Navigator}} object in
  <code>inner.html</code> would be permanently storing a {{Promise}} object created in
  <code>outer.html</code>'s <a>JavaScript realm</a>, and calls like that inside the
  <code>hello()</code> function would thus return a promise from the "wrong" realm. Since this is
  undesirable, the algorithm instead uses the <a>relevant Realm</a>, giving the sensible results
  indicated in the comments above.
  </div>

  The rest of this section deals with formally defining the <a>entry</a>, <a>incumbent</a>,
  <a>current</a>, and <a>relevant</a> concepts.

<h6 id="concept-entry">Entry</h6>

  All <a>realm execution contexts</a> must contain, as part of their code evaluation state, an
  <dfn>entrance counter</dfn> value, which is initially zero. In the process of <a>calling scripts</a>,
  this value will be incremented and decremented.

  With this in hand, we define the <dfn>entry execution context</dfn> to be the most recently pushed
  entry in the <a>JavaScript execution context stack</a> whose <a>entrance counter</a> value is
  greater than zero. The <dfn>entry Realm</dfn> is the <a>entry execution context</a>'s Realm
  component.

  Then, the <dfn>entry settings object</dfn> is the <a>environment settings object</a> of the
  <a>entry Realm</a>.

  Similarly, the <dfn>entry global object</dfn> is the <a>global object</a> of the
  <a>entry Realm</a>.

<h6 id="concept-incumbent">Incumbent</h6>

  The <dfn>incumbent settings object</dfn> is determined as follows:

  1. Let <var>scriptOrModule</var> be the result of JavaScript's <a>GetActiveScriptOrModule</a>()
      abstract operation.
  2. If <var>scriptOrModule</var> is null, abort these steps; there is no <a>incumbent settings
      object</a>.
  3. Return the <a>settings object</a> of the <{script}> in <var>scriptOrModule</var>'s
      \[[HostDefined]] field.

  Then, the <dfn>incumbent Realm</dfn> is the <a>Realm</a> of the <a>incumbent settings object</a>.

  Similarly, the <dfn>incumbent global object</dfn> is the <a>global object</a> of the <a>incumbent
  settings object</a>.

<h6 id="concept-current">Current</h6>

  The JavaScript specification defines the <a>current Realm Record</a>, sometimes abbreviated to the
  "current Realm". [[ECMA-262]]

  Then, the <dfn>current settings object</dfn> is the <a>environment settings object</a> of the
  <a>current Realm Record</a>.

  Similarly, the <dfn>current global object</dfn> is the <a>global object</a> of the
  <a>current Realm Record</a>.

<h6 id="concept-relevant">Relevant</h6>

  The <dfn>relevant settings object</dfn> for a <a>platform object</a> is defined as follows:

  <dl class="switch">
    <dt>If the object is a <a>global object</a></dt>
    <dd>Each <a>global object</a> in this specification is created alongside a corresponding
    <a>environment settings object</a>; that is its <a>relevant settings object</a>.</dd>

    <dt>Otherwise</dt>
    <dd>The <a>relevant settings object</a> for a non-global <a>platform object</a> <var>o</var> is
    the <a>environment settings object</a> whose <a>global object</a> is the global object of the
    <a>global environment associated with</a> <var>o</var>.

    <p class="note">The "<a>global environment associated with</a>" concept is from the olden days,
    before the modern JavaScript specification and its concept of <a>realms</a>. We expect that as
    the Web IDL specification gets updated, every <a>platform object</a> will have a <a>Realm</a>
    associated with it, and this definition can be re-cast in those terms. [[ECMA-262]] [[WEBIDL]]
    </p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  Then, the <dfn>relevant Realm</dfn> for a <a>platform object</a> is the <a>Realm</a> of its
  <a>relevant settings object</a>.

  Similarly, the <dfn>relevant global object</dfn> for a <a>platform object</a> is the
  <a>global object</a> of its <a>relevant settings object</a>.

<h5 id="killing-scripts">Killing scripts</h5>

  Although the JavaScript specification does not account for this possibility, it's sometimes
  necessary to
  <dfn lt="abort a running script|aborted the running script|aborting the running script|aborted prematurely|abort the script">abort a running script</dfn>.
  This causes any <a>ScriptEvaluation</a> or <a>ModuleEvaluation</a> to cease immediately, emptying
  the <a>JavaScript execution context stack</a> without triggering any of the normal mechanisms like
  <code>finally</code> blocks. [[ECMA-262]]

  User agents may impose resource limitations on scripts, for example CPU quotas, memory limits,
  total execution time limits, or bandwidth limitations. When a script exceeds a limit, the user
  agent may either throw a {{QuotaExceededError}} exception, <a>abort the script</a> without an
  exception, prompt the user, or throttle script execution.

  <div class="example">
    For example, the following script never terminates. A user agent could, after waiting for a
    few seconds, prompt the user to either terminate the script or let it continue.

    <xmp highlight="html">
      <script>
        while (true) { /* loop */ }
      </script>
    </xmp>
  </div>

  User agents are encouraged to allow users to disable scripting whenever the user is prompted
  either by a script (e.g., using the {{Window/alert()|window.alert()}} API) or because
  of a script's actions (e.g., because it has exceeded a time limit).

  If scripting is disabled while a script is executing, the script should be terminated
  immediately.

  User agents may allow users to specifically disable scripts just for the purposes of closing a
  <a>browsing context</a>.

  <p class="example">For example, the prompt mentioned in the example above could also offer the
  user with a mechanism to just close the page entirely, without running any <code>unload</code>
  event handlers.</p>

<h5 id="integration-with-the-javascript-job-queue">Integration with the JavaScript job queue</h5>

  The JavaScript specification defines the JavaScript job and job queue abstractions in order to
  specify certain invariants about how promise operations execute with a clean <a>JavaScript
  execution context stack</a> and in a certain order. However, as of the time of this writing
  the definition of <a>EnqueueJob</a> in that specification are not sufficiently flexible to
  integrate with HTML as a host environment. [[!ECMA-262]]

  <p class="note">
    This is not strictly true. It is in fact possible, by taking liberal advantage of
    the many "implementation defined" sections of the algorithm, to contort it to our purposes.
    However, the end result is a mass of messy indirection and workarounds that essentially bypasses
    the job queue infrastructure entirely, albeit in a way that is technically sanctioned within the
    bounds of implementation-defined behavior. We do not take this path, and instead introduce the
    following <a>willful violation</a>.
  </p>

  As such, user agents must instead use the following definition in place of that in the
  JavaScript specification. These ensure that the promise jobs enqueued by the JavaScript
  specification are properly integrated into the user agent's <a>event
  loops</a>.

<h6 id="enqueusjob"><a>EnqueueJob</a>(<var>queueName</var>, <var>job</var>, <var>arguments</var>)</h6>

  When the JavaScript specification says to call the EnqueueJob abstract operation, the
  following algorithm must be used in place of JavaScript's <a>EnqueueJob</a>:

  1. Assert: <var>queueName</var> is <code>"PromiseJobs"</code>. (<code>"ScriptJobs"</code> must not
      be used by user agents.)
  2. Let <var>settings</var> be the <a>settings object</a> of <var>job</var>.\[[Realm]]
  3. <a>Queue a microtask</a>, on <var>settings</var>'s <a>responsible event loop</a>, to perform
      the following steps:

      1. <a>Check if we can run script</a> with <var>settings</var>. If this returns "do not run"
          then abort these steps.
      2. <a>Prepare to run script</a> with <var>settings</var>.
      3. Let <var>result</var> be the result of performing the abstract operation specified by
          <var>job</var>, using the elements of <var>arguments</var> as its arguments.
      4. <a>Clean up after running script</a> with <var>settings</var>.
      5. If <var>result</var> is an abrupt completion, <a>report the exception</a> given by
          <var>result</var>.\[[Value]].

<h5 id="integration-with-the-javascript-module-system">Integration with the JavaScript module system</h5>

  The JavaScript specification defines a syntax for modules, as well as some host-agnostic parts of
  their processing model. This specification defines the rest of their processing model: how the
  module system is bootstrapped, via the <{script}> element with <{script/type}> attribute set to
  "<code>module</code>", and how modules are fetched, resolved, and executed. [[ECMA-262]]

  <p class="note">Although the JavaScript specification speaks in terms of "scripts" versus
  "modules", in general this specification speaks in terms of <a>classic scripts</a> versus
  <a>module scripts</a>, since both of them use the <{script}> element.</p>

  A <dfn>module map</dfn> is a map of <a>absolute URLs</a> to values that are either a <a>module
  script</a>, null, or a placeholder value "<code>fetching</code>". <a>Module maps</a> are used to
  ensure that imported JavaScript modules are only fetched, parsed, and evaluated once per
  {{Document}} or {{Worker}}.

  To <dfn lt="resolve a module specifier|resolving a module specifier">resolve a module specifier</dfn>
  given a <a>module script</a> <var>script</var> and a string <var>specifier</var>, perform the
  following steps. It will return either an <a>absolute URL</a> or failure.

  1. Apply the <a>URL parser</a> to <var>specifier</var>. If the result is not failure, return the
      result.
  2. If <var>specifier</var> does not start with the character U+002F SOLIDUS (/), the two-character
      sequence U+002E FULL STOP, U+002F SOLIDUS (./), or the three-character sequence
      U+002E FULL STOP, U+002E FULL STOP, U+002F SOLIDUS (../), return failure and abort these
      steps.

      <p class="note">This restriction is in place so that in the future we can allow custom module
      loaders to give special meaning to "bare" import specifiers, like <code>import "jquery"</code>
      or <code>import "web/crypto"</code>. For now any such imports will fail, instead of being
      treated as relative URLs.</p>
  3. Return the result of applying the <a>URL parser</a> to <var>specifier</var> with
      <var>script</var>'s <a>base URL</a> as the base URL.

<h6 id="hostresolveimportedmodule">HostResolveImportedModule(<var>referencingModule</var>, <var>specifier</var>)</h6>

  JavaScript contains an implementation-defined <a>HostResolveImportedModule</a> abstract operation.
  User agents must use the following implementation: [[ECMA-262]]

  1. Let <var>referencing module script</var> be <var>referencingModule</var>.\[[HostDefined]].
  2. Let <var>module map</var> be <var>referencing module script</var>'s <a>settings object</a>'s
      <a>module map</a>.
  3. Let <var>url</var> be the result of <a>resolving a module specifier</a> given <var>referencing
      module script</var> and <var>specifier</var>. If the result is failure, throw a {{TypeError}}
      exception and abort these steps.
  4. Let <var>resolved module script</var> be the value of the entry in <var>module map</var> whose
      key is <var>url</var>. If no such entry exists, or if the value is null or
      "<code>fetching</code>", throw a {{TypeError}} exception and abort these steps.
  5. Return <var>resolved module script</var>'s <a>module record</a>.

<h5 id="sec-runtime-script-errors"><dfn>Runtime script errors</dfn></h5>

  When the user agent is required to
  <dfn lt="report the error|report an error">report an error</dfn> for a
  particular [=concept/script=] <var>script</var> with a particular
  position <var>line</var>:<var>col</var>, using a particular target <var>target</var>, it must run
  these steps, after which the error is either <dfn for="script">handled</dfn> or
  <dfn for="script">not handled</dfn>:

  1. If <var>target</var> is <a>in error reporting mode</a>, then abort these steps; the error is
      <a for="script">not handled</a>.
  2. Let <var>target</var> be <dfn>in error reporting mode</dfn>.
  3. Let <var>message</var> be a user-agent-defined string describing the error in a helpful manner.
  4. Let <var>error object</var> be the object that represents the error: in the case of an uncaught
      exception, that would be the object that was thrown; in the case of a JavaScript error that
      would be an {{Error}} object. If there is no corresponding object, then the null value must be
      used instead.
  5. Let <var>location</var> be an <a>absolute URL</a> that corresponds to the resource from which
      <var>script</var> was obtained.

      <p class="note">The resource containing the script will typically be the file from which the
      {{Document}} was parsed, e.g., for inline <{script}> elements or <a>event handler content
      attributes</a>; or the JavaScript file that the script was in, for external scripts. Even for
      dynamically-generated scripts, user agents are strongly encouraged to attempt to keep track of
      the original source of a script. For example, if an external script uses the
      {{Document/write()|document.write()}} API to insert an inline <{script}> element during
      parsing, the URL of the resource containing the script would ideally be reported as being the
      external script, and the line number might ideally be reported as the line with the
      {{Document/write()|document.write()}} call or where the string passed to that call was first
      constructed. Naturally, implementing this can be somewhat non-trivial.</p>

      <p class="note">User agents are similarly encouraged to keep careful track of the original
      line numbers, even in the face of {{Document/write()|document.write()}} calls mutating the
      document as it is parsed, or <a>event handler content attributes</a> spanning multiple lines.
      </p>
  6. If <var>script</var> has <a>muted errors</a>, then set <var>message</var> to
      "<code>Script error.</code>", set <var>location</var> to the empty string, set <var>line</var>
      and <var>col</var> to 0, and set <var>error object</var> to null.
  7. Let <var>event</var> be a new <a>trusted</a> {{ErrorEvent}} object that does not bubble but is
      cancelable, and which has the event name <a event for="global"><code>error</code></a>.
  8. Initialize <var>event</var>'s {{ErrorEvent/message}} attribute to <var>message</var>.
  9. Initialize <var>event</var>'s {{ErrorEvent/filename}} attribute to <var>location</var>.
  10. Initialize <var>event</var>'s {{ErrorEvent/lineno}} attribute to <var>line</var>.
  11. Initialize <var>event</var>'s {{ErrorEvent/colno}} attribute to <var>col</var>.
  12. Initialize <var>event</var>'s {{ErrorEvent/error}} attribute to <var>error object</var>.
  13. <a>Dispatch</a> <var>event</var> at <var>target</var>.

  In addition to synchronous <a>runtime script errors</a>, scripts may experience asynchronous
  promise rejections, tracked via the <code>unhandledrejection</code> and
  <code>rejectionhandled</code> events.

  When the user agent is to <dfn>notify about rejected promises</dfn> on a given <a>environment
  settings object</a> <var>settings object</var>, it must run these steps:

  1. Let <var>list</var> be a copy of <var>settings object</var>'s <a>about-to-be-notified

  2. If <var>list</var> is empty, abort these steps.

          1. If <var>p</var>'s \[[PromiseIsHandled]] internal slot is true, continue to the next
              iteration of the loop.
          2. Let <var>event</var> be a new <a>trusted</a> <code>PromiseRejectionEvent</code> object
              that does not bubble but is cancelable, and which has the event name

              <var>p</var>.
          4. Initialise <var>event</var>'s {{PromiseRejectionEvent/reason}} attribute to the value
              of <var>p</var>'s \[[PromiseResult]] internal slot.
          5. <a>Dispatch</a> <var>event</var> at <var>settings object</var>'s <a>global object</a>.
          6. If the event was canceled, then the promise rejection is <a for="promise">handled</a>.
              Otherwise, the promise rejection is <a for="promise">not handled</a>.
          7. If <var>p</var>'s \[[PromiseIsHandled]] internal slot is false, add <var>p</var> to
              <var>settings object</var>'s <a>outstanding rejected promises weak set</a>.

  This algorithm results in promise rejections being marked as <dfn for="promise">handled</dfn> or

<h4 id="event-loops">Event loops</h4>

<h5 id="event-loops-definitions">Definitions</h5>

  To coordinate events, user interaction, scripts, rendering, networking, and so forth, user agents
  must use <dfn lt="event loop|event loops">event loops</dfn> as described in this section. There
  are two kinds of event loops: those for <a>browsing contexts</a>, and those for
  {{Worker|workers}}.

  There must be at least one <a>browsing context</a> <a>event loop</a> per user
  agent, and at most one per <a>unit of related similar-origin browsing contexts</a>.

  <p class="note">
  When there is more than one <a>event loop</a> for a <a>unit of related browsing contexts</a>,
  complications arise when a <a>browsing context</a> in that group is <a>navigated</a> such that it
  switches from one <a>unit of related similar-origin browsing contexts</a> to another. This
  specification does not currently describe how to handle these complications.</p>

  A <a>browsing context</a> <a>event loop</a> always has at least one <a>browsing context</a>. If
  such an <a>event loop</a>'s <a>browsing contexts</a> all go away, then the <a>event loop</a> goes
  away as well. A <a>browsing context</a> always has an <a>event loop</a> coordinating its
  activities.

  <a>Worker event loops</a> are simpler: each worker has one <a>event loop</a>, and the <a>worker
  processing model</a> manages the <a>event loop</a>'s lifetime.

  <hr />

  An <a>event loop</a> has one or more <dfn>task queues</dfn>. A <a>task queue</a> is an ordered
  list of <dfn>tasks</dfn>, which are algorithms that are responsible for such work as:

  : Events
  :: Dispatching an {{Event}} object at a particular {{EventTarget}} object is often done by a
      dedicated task.

      <p class="note">Not all events are dispatched using the <a>task queue</a>, many are
      dispatched during other tasks.</p>

  : Parsing
  :: The <a>HTML parser</a> tokenizing one or more bytes, and then processing any resulting tokens,
      is typically a task.

  : Callbacks
  :: Calling a callback is often done by a dedicated task.

  : Using a resource
  :: When an algorithm <a>fetches</a> a resource, if the fetching occurs in a non-blocking fashion
      then the processing of the resource once some or all of the resource is available is performed
      by a task.

  : Reacting to DOM manipulation
  :: Some elements have tasks that trigger in response to DOM manipulation, e.g., when that element
      is <a for="document">inserted into the document</a>.

  Each <a>task</a> in a <a>browsing context</a> <a>event loop</a> is associated with a {{Document}};
  if the task was queued in the context of an element, then it is the element's
  <a>node document</a>; if the task was queued in the context of a <a>browsing context</a>, then it
  is the <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a> at the time the task was queued; if the
  task was queued by or for a [=concept/script=] then the document is the
  <a>responsible document</a> specified by the script's <a>settings object</a>.

  A <a>task</a> is intended for a specific <a>event loop</a>: the <a>event loop</a> that is handling
  <a>tasks</a> for the <a>task</a>'s associated {{Document}} or {{Worker}}.

  When a user agent is to <dfn lt="queuing|queue a task|queues a task">queue a task</dfn>, it must
  add the given task to one of the <a>task queues</a> of the relevant <a>event loop</a>.

  Each <a>task</a> is defined as coming from a specific <dfn>task source</dfn>. All the tasks from
  one particular <a>task source</a> and destined to a particular <a>event loop</a> (e.g., the
  callbacks generated by timers of a {{Document}}, the events fired for mouse movements over that
  {{Document}}, the tasks queued for the parser of that <code>Document</code>) must always be added
  to the same <a>task queue</a>, but <a>tasks</a> from different <a>task sources</a> may be placed
  in different <a>task queues</a>.

  <p class="example">
  For example, a user agent could have one <a>task queue</a> for mouse and
  key events (the <a>user interaction task source</a>), and another for everything else. The
  user agent could then give keyboard and mouse events preference over other tasks three quarters of
  the time, keeping the interface responsive but not starving other task queues, and never
  processing events from any one <a>task source</a> out of order.
  </p>

  Each <a>event loop</a> has a <dfn>currently running task</dfn>. Initially, this is null.
  It is used to handle reentrancy. Each <a>event loop</a> also has a
  <dfn>performing a microtask checkpoint flag</dfn>, which must initially be false. It is used to
  prevent reentrant invocation of the <a>perform a microtask checkpoint</a> algorithm.

<h5 id="event-loops-processing-model">Processing model</h5>

  An <a>event loop</a> must continually run through the following steps for as long as it exists:

  1. Select the oldest <a>task</a> on one of the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>task queues</a>, if any,
      ignoring, in the case of a <a>browsing context</a> <a>event loop</a>, tasks whose associated
      {{Document}}s are not <a>fully active</a>. The user agent may pick any <a>task queue</a>. If
      there is no task to select, then jump to the <var>Microtasks</var> step below.
  2. Set the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>currently running task</a> to the <a>task</a> selected in the
      previous step.
  3. <var>Run</var>: Run the selected <a>task</a>.
  4. Set the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>currently running task</a> back to null.
  5. Remove the task that was run in the <var>Run</var> step above from its <a>task queue</a>.
  6. <var>Microtasks</var>: <a>Perform a microtask checkpoint</a>.
  7. <em>Update the rendering</em>: If this <a>event loop</a> is a <a>browsing context</a>
      <a>event loop</a> (as opposed to a {{Worker}} <a>event loop</a>), then run the following
      substeps.

      1. Let <var>now</var> be the value that would be returned by the {{Performance}} object's
          {{Performance/now()}} method. [[!HR-TIME-2]]
      2. Let <var>docs</var> be the list of {{Document}} objects associated with the
          <a>event loop</a> in question, sorted arbitrarily except that the following conditions
          must be met:

          * Any {{Document}} <var>B</var> that is <a>nested through</a> a {{Document}} <var>A</var>
             must be listed after <var>A</var> in the list.
          * If there are two documents <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> whose <a>browsing contexts</a>
             are both <a>nested browsing contexts</a> and their <a>browsing context containers</a>
             are both elements in the same {{Document}} <var>C</var>, then the order of <var>A</var>
             and <var>B</var> in the list must match the relative <a>tree order</a> of their
             respective <a>browsing context containers</a> in <var>C</var>.

          In the steps below that iterate over <var>docs</var>, each {{Document}} must be processed
          in the order it is found in the list.
      3. If there is a <a>top-level browsing context</a> <var>B</var> that the user agent believes
          would not benefit from having its rendering updated at this time, then remove from
          <var>docs</var> all {{Document}} objects whose <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>top-level
          browsing context</a> is <var>B</var>.

          <p class="note">
            There are many factors that affect the ideal update frequency for the <a>top-level
            browsing context</a> including performance, power, background operation, quality of
            user experience, refresh rate of display(s), etc. When in foreground and not
            constrained by resources (i.e. performance, battery versus mains power, other resource
            limits), the user agent normally prioritizes for maximum quality of user
            experience for that set of {{Document}}s by matching update frequency and
            <a lt='run the animation frame callbacks'>animation frame callback</a> rate to the
            current refresh rate of the current display (usually 60Hz, but refresh rate may be
            higher or lower). When accommodating constraints on resources, the update frequency
            might automatically run at a lower rate. Also, if a <a>top-level browsing context</a>
            is in the background, the user agent might decide to drop that page to a much slower
            4Hz, or even less.

            Another example of why a browser might skip updating the rendering is to ensure certain
            <a>tasks</a> are executed immediately after each other, with only
            <a>microtask checkpoints</a> interleaved (and without, e.g.,
            <a lt='run the animation frame callbacks'>animation frame callbacks</a> interleaved).
            For example, a user agent might wish to coalesce callbacks together, with no
            intermediate rendering updates. However, when are no constraints on resources,
            there must not be an arbitrary permanent user agent limit on the update rate and
            <a lt='run the animation frame callbacks'>animation frame callback</a> rate

          rendering third-party content, especially if it is not currently visible to the user or if
          resources are constrained. In such cases, the browser could decide to update the rendering
          for such content infrequently or never.</p>

  <hr />

  Each <a>event loop</a> has a <dfn>microtask queue</dfn>. A <dfn>microtask</dfn> is a <a>task</a>
  that is originally to be queued on the <a>microtask queue</a> rather than a <a>task queue</a>.
  There are two kinds of <a>microtasks</a>: <dfn>solitary callback microtasks</dfn>, and
  <dfn>compound microtasks</dfn>.

  <p class="note">This specification only has <a>solitary callback microtasks</a>. Specifications
  that use <a>compound microtasks</a> have to take extra care to <a>wrap callbacks</a> to handle
  <a>spinning the event loop</a>.</p>

  When an algorithm requires a <a>microtask</a> to be
  <dfn lt="queue a microtask|queued">queued</dfn>, it must be appended to the relevant
  <a>event loop</a>'s <a>microtask queue</a>; the <a>task source</a> of such a <a>microtask</a> is
  the <dfn>microtask task source</dfn>.

  <p class="note">It is possible for a <a>microtask</a> to be moved to a regular <a>task queue</a>,
  if, during its initial execution, it <a>spins the event loop</a>. In that case, the <a>microtask
  task source</a> is the <a>task source</a> used. Normally, the <a>task source</a> of a
  <a>microtask</a> is irrelevant.</p>

  When a user agent is to
  <dfn lt="performs a microtask checkpoint|perform a microtask checkpoint|microtask checkpoints">perform a microtask checkpoint</dfn>,
  if the <a>performing a microtask checkpoint flag</a> is false, then the user agent must run the
  following steps:

  1. Let the <a>performing a microtask checkpoint flag</a> be true.
  2. <var>Microtask queue handling</var>: If the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>microtask queue</a> is
      empty, jump to the <var>Done</var> step below.
  3. Select the oldest <a>microtask</a> on the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>microtask queue</a>.
  4. Set the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>currently running task</a> to the <a>task</a> selected in the
      previous step.
  5. <var>Run</var>: Run the selected <a>task</a>.

      <p class="note">This might involve invoking scripted callbacks, which eventually calls the
      <a>clean up after running script</a> steps, which call this
      <a>perform a microtask checkpoint</a> algorithm again, which is why we use the
      <a>performing a microtask checkpoint flag</a> to avoid reentrancy.</p>
  6. Set the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>currently running task</a> back to null.
  7. Remove the <a>microtask</a> run in the step above from the <a>microtask queue</a>, and return
      to the <var>Microtask queue handling</var> step.
  8. <var>Done</var>: For each <a>environment settings object</a> whose <a>responsible event
      loop</a> is this <a>event loop</a>, <a>notify about rejected promises</a> on that
      <a>environment settings object</a>.
  9. <a>Cleanup Indexed Database transactions</a>.
  10. Let the <a>performing a microtask checkpoint flag</a> be false.

  If, while a <a>compound microtask</a> is running, the user agent is required to
  <dfn lt="wrap callbacks|execute a compound microtask subtask">execute a compound microtask subtask</dfn>
  to run a series of steps, the user agent must run the following steps:

  1. Let <var>parent</var> be the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>currently running task</a> (the currently
      running <a>compound microtask</a>).
  2. Let <var>subtask</var> be a new <a>task</a> that consists of running the given series of steps.
      The <a>task source</a> of such a <a>microtask</a> is the <a>microtask task source</a>. This is
      a <dfn>compound microtask subtask</dfn>.
  3. Set the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>currently running task</a> to <var>subtask</var>.
  4. Run <var>subtask</var>.
  5. Set the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>currently running task</a> back to <var>parent</var>.

  When an algorithm running <a>in parallel</a> is to
  <dfn lt="provides a stable state|await a stable state">await a stable state</dfn>, the
  user agent must <a>queue a microtask</a> that runs the following steps, and must then stop
  executing (execution of the algorithm resumes when the microtask is run, as described in the
  following steps):

  1. Run the algorithm's <dfn lt="synchronous section|synchronous sections">synchronous section</dfn>.
  2. Resumes execution of the algorithm <a>in parallel</a>, if appropriate, as described in the
      algorithm's steps.

  When an algorithm says to
  <dfn lt="spinning the event loop|spin the event loop|spins the event loop">spin the event loop</dfn>
  until a condition <var>goal</var> is met, the user agent must run the following steps:

  1. Let <var>task</var> be the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>currently running task</a>.

      <p class="note">This might be a <a>microtask</a>, in which case it is a <a>solitary callback

      that is not a <a>microtask</a>. It will <em>not</em> be a <a>compound microtask</a>.</p>
  2. Let <var>task source</var> be <var>task</var>'s <a>task source</a>.
  3. Let <var>old stack</var> be a copy of the <a>JavaScript execution context stack</a>.
  4. Empty the <a>JavaScript execution context stack</a>.
  5. <a>Run the global script clean-up jobs</a>.
  6. <a>Perform a microtask checkpoint</a>.
  7. Stop <var>task</var>, allowing whatever algorithm that invoked it to resume, but continue these
      steps <a>in parallel</a>.

      <p class="note">This causes one of the following algorithms to continue: the

  8. Wait until the condition <var>goal</var> is met.
  9. <a>Queue a task</a> to continue running these steps, using the <a>task source</a>
      <var>task source</var>. Wait until this new task runs before continuing these steps.
  10. Replace the <a>JavaScript execution context stack</a> with the <var>old stack</var>.
  11. Return to the caller.

  <hr />

  Some of the algorithms in this specification, for historical reasons, require the user agent to
  <dfn state for="useragent" lt="Pause|pause">pause</dfn> while running a <a>task</a> until a
  condition <var>goal</var> is met. This means running the following steps:

  1. If necessary, update the rendering or user interface of any {{Document}} or
      <a>browsing context</a> to reflect the current state.
  2. Wait until the condition <var>goal</var> is met. While a user agent has a paused <a>task</a>,
      the corresponding <a>event loop</a> must not run further <a>tasks</a>, and any script in the
      currently running <a>task</a> must block. User agents should remain responsive to user input
      while paused, however, albeit in a reduced capacity since the <a>event loop</a> will not be
      doing anything.

<h5 id="generic-task-sources">Generic task sources</h5>

  The following <a>task sources</a> are used by a number of mostly unrelated features in this and
  other specifications.

  : The <dfn>DOM manipulation task source</dfn>
  :: This <a>task source</a> is used for features that react to DOM manipulations, such as things
      that happen in a non-blocking fashion when an element is <a for="document">inserted into the
      document</a>.

  : The <dfn>user interaction task source</dfn>
  :: This <a>task source</a> is used for features that react to user interaction, for example
      keyboard or mouse input.

      Events sent in response to user input (e.g., <code>click</code> events) must be fired using
      <a>tasks</a> <a>queued</a> with the <a>user interaction task source</a>. [[!UIEVENTS]]

  : The <dfn>networking task source</dfn>
  :: This <a>task source</a> is used for features that trigger in response to network activity.

  : The <dfn>history traversal task source</dfn>
  :: This <a>task source</a> is used to queue calls to {{History/back()|history.back()}} and
      similar APIs.

<h4 id="events">Events</h4>

<h5 id="events-event-handlers">Event handlers</h5>

  Many objects can have <dfn lt="event handler|event handlers">event handlers</dfn> specified. These
  act as non-capture event listeners for the object on which they are specified. [[!DOM]]

  An <a>event handler</a> has a name, which always starts with
  "<code>on</code>" and is followed by the name of the event for which it is intended.

  An <a>event handler</a> has a value, which is either null, or is a callback object, or is an
  <a>internal raw uncompiled handler</a>. The {{EventHandler}} callback function type describes how
  this is exposed to scripts. Initially, an <a>event handler</a>'s value must be set to null.

  Event handlers are exposed in one of two ways.

  The first way, common to all event handlers, is as an <a>event handler IDL attribute</a>.

  The second way is as an <a>event handler content attribute</a>. Event handlers on
  <a>HTML elements</a> and some of the event handlers on {{Window}} objects are exposed in this way.

  <hr />

  An <dfn for="event handler idl" lt="event handler IDL attribute|event handler IDL attributes">event handler IDL attribute</dfn>
  is an IDL attribute for a specific <a>event handler</a>. The name of the IDL attribute is the same
  as the name of the <a>event handler</a>.

  <a>Event handler IDL attributes</a>, on setting, must set the corresponding <a>event handler</a>
  to their new value, and on getting, must return the result of <a>getting the current value of the
  event handler</a> in question (this can throw an exception, in which case the getting propagates
  it to the caller, it does not catch it).

  If an <a>event handler IDL attribute</a> exposes an <a>event handler</a> of an object that doesn't
  exist, it must always return null on getting and must do nothing on setting.

  <p class="note">This can happen in particular for <a>event handler IDL attribute</a> on <{body}>
  elements that do not have corresponding {{Window}} objects.</p>

  <p class="note">Certain event handler IDL attributes have additional requirements, in particular
  the <code>onmessage</code> attribute of {{MessagePort}} objects.</p>

  <hr />

  An <dfn for="event handler content" lt="event handler content attribute|event handler content attributes">event handler content attribute</dfn>
  is a content attribute for a specific <a>event handler</a>. The name of the content attribute is
  the same as the name of the <a>event handler</a>.

  <a>Event handler content attributes</a>, when specified, must contain valid JavaScript code which,
  when parsed, would match the <a>FunctionBody</a> production after automatic semicolon insertion.
  [[!ECMA-262]]

  When an <a>event handler content attribute</a> is set, execute the following steps:

  1. If the <a>Should element's inline behavior be blocked by Content Security Policy?</a> algorithm
      returns "<code>Blocked</code>" when executed upon the attribute's element
      "<code>script attribute</code>", and the attribute's value, then abort these steps. [[!CSP3]]
  2. Set the corresponding <a>event handler</a> to an <a>internal raw uncompiled handler</a>
      consisting of the attribute's new value and the script location where the attribute was set to
      this value.

  When an <a>event handler content attribute</a> is removed, the user agent must set the
  corresponding <a>event handler</a> to null.

  <hr />

  When an <a>event handler</a> <var>H</var> of an element or object <var>T</var> implementing the
  {{EventTarget}} interface is first set to a non-null value, the user agent must append an
  <a>event listener</a> to the list of <a>event listeners</a> associated with <var>T</var> with
  <b>type</b> set to the <dfn>event handler event type</dfn> corresponding to <var>H</var> and
  <b>callback</b> set to <a>the event handler processing algorithm</a> defined below. [[!DOM]]

  <p class="note">The <b>callback</b> is emphatically <em>not</em> the <a>event handler</a>
  itself. Every event handler ends up registering the same <b>callback</b> the algorithm
  defined below, which takes care of invoking the right callback, and processing the callback's
  return value.</p>

  <p class="note">
  This only happens the first time the <a>event
  handler</a>'s value is set. Since listeners are called in the order they were registered, the
  order of event listeners for a particular event type will always be first the event listeners
  registered with <code>addEventListener()</code> before
  the first time the <a>event handler</a> was set to a non-null value,
  then the callback to which it is currently set, if any, and finally the event listeners registered
  with <code>addEventListener()</code> <em>after</em> the
  first time the <a>event handler</a> was set to a non-null value.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    This example demonstrates the order in which event listeners are invoked. If the button in
    this example is clicked by the user, the page will show four alerts, with the text "ONE", "TWO",
    "THREE", and "FOUR" respectively.

    <xmp highlight="html">
    <button>Start Demo</button>
    <script>
    var button = document.getElementById('test');
    button.addEventListener('click', function () { alert('ONE') }, false);
    button.setAttribute('onclick', "alert('NOT CALLED')"); // event handler listener is registered here
    button.addEventListener('click', function () { alert('THREE') }, false);
    button.onclick = function () { alert('TWO'); };
    button.addEventListener('click', function () { alert('FOUR') }, false);
    </script>
    </xmp>
  </div>

  <p class="note">The interfaces implemented by the event object do not influence whether an
  <a>event handler</a> is triggered or not.</p>

  <dfn>The event handler processing algorithm</dfn> for an <a>event handler</a> <var>H</var> and an
  {{Event}} object <var>E</var> is as follows:

  1. Let <var>callback</var> be the result of <a>getting the current value of the event handler</a>
      <var>H</var>.
  2. If <var>callback</var> is null, then abort these steps.
  3. Process the {{Event}} object <var>E</var> as follows:

      <dl class="switch">
        <dt>If <var>E</var> is an {{ErrorEvent}} object and the <a>event handler IDL attribute</a>'s
        type is <code>OnErrorEventHandler</code></dt>
        <dd><a>Invoke</a> <var>callback</var> with five arguments, the first one having the value of
        <var>E</var>'s {{ErrorEvent/message}} attribute, the second having the value of

        <var>E</var>'s {{ErrorEvent/lineno}} attribute, the fourth having the value of
        <var>E</var>'s {{ErrorEvent/colno}} attribute, the fifth having the value of
        <var>E</var>'s {{ErrorEvent/error}} attribute, and with the
        <a spec="webidl">callback this value</a> set to <var>E</var>'s {{Event/currentTarget}}. Let

        </dd>
      </dl>

      In this step, <dfn>invoke</dfn> means to <a>invoke the Web IDL callback function</a>.

      If an exception gets thrown by the callback, end these steps and allow the exception to

  4. Process <var>return value</var> as follows:

  <hr />

  The {{EventHandler}} callback function type represents a callback used for event handlers. It is
  represented in Web IDL as follows:

  <pre class="idl" data-highlight="webidl">
    [TreatNonObjectAsNull]
    callback EventHandlerNonNull = any (Event event);
    typedef EventHandlerNonNull? EventHandler;
  </pre>

  <p class="note">In JavaScript, any {{Function}} object implements this interface.</p>

  <div class="example">
    For example, the following document fragment:

    <xmp highlight="html"><body onload="alert(this)" onclick="alert(this)"></xmp>

    ...leads to an alert saying "<code>[object&nbsp;Window]</code>" when the document is
    loaded, and an alert saying "<code>[object&nbsp;HTMLBodyElement]</code>" whenever the
    user clicks something in the page.
  </div>

  <p class="note">The return value of the function affects whether the event is canceled or not:
  as described above, if the return value is false, the event is canceled (except for
  <code>mouseover</code> events, where the return value has to be true to cancel the event). With
  <code>beforeunload</code> events, the value is instead used to determine whether or not to prompt
  about unloading the document.</p>

  For historical reasons, the {{GlobalEventHandlers/onerror}} handler has different arguments:

  <pre class="idl" data-highlight="webidl">
    [TreatNonObjectAsNull]
    callback OnErrorEventHandlerNonNull = any ((Event or DOMString) event, optional DOMString source, optional unsigned long lineno, optional unsigned long column, optional any error);
    typedef OnErrorEventHandlerNonNull? OnErrorEventHandler;
  </pre>

  Similarly, the {{OnBeforeUnloadEventHandler/onbeforeunload}} handler has a different return value:

  <pre class="idl" data-highlight="webidl">
    [TreatNonObjectAsNull]
    callback OnBeforeUnloadEventHandlerNonNull = DOMString? (Event event);
    typedef OnBeforeUnloadEventHandlerNonNull? OnBeforeUnloadEventHandler;
  </pre>

  An <dfn>internal raw uncompiled handler</dfn> is a tuple with the following information:

  * An uncompiled script body
  * A location where the script body originated, in case an error needs to be reported

  When the user agent is to
  <dfn lt="getting the current value of the event handler|get the current value of the event handler">get the current value of the event handler</dfn>
  <var>H</var>, it must run these steps:

  1. If <var>H</var>'s value is an <a>internal raw uncompiled handler</a>, run these substeps:

      1. If <var>H</var> is an element's <a>event handler</a>, then let <var>element</var> be the
          element, and <var>document</var> be the element's <a>node document</a>.

          Otherwise, <var>H</var> is a {{Window}} object's <a>event handler</a>: let
          <var>element</var> be null, and let <var>document</var> be the {{Document}} most recently
          associated with that {{Window}} object.
      2. If <var>document</var> does not have a <a>browsing context</a>, or if <a>scripting is
          enabled</a> for <var>document</var>'s <a>browsing context</a>, then return null.
      3. Let <var>body</var> be the uncompiled script body in the <a>internal raw uncompiled
          handler</a>.
      4. Let <var>location</var> be the location where the script body originated, as given by the
          <a>internal raw uncompiled handler</a>.
      5. If <var>element</var> is not null and <var>element</var> has a <a>form owner</a>, let
          <var>form owner</var> be that <a>form owner</a>. Otherwise, let <var>form owner</var> be
          null.
      6. Let <var>script settings</var> be the <a>environment settings object</a> created for the
          {{Window}} object with which <var>document</var> is currently associated.
      7. If <var>body</var> is not parsable as <a>FunctionBody</a> or if parsing detects an
          <a>early error</a>, then follow these substeps:

<h5 id="event-firing">Event firing</h5>

  Certain operations and methods are defined as firing events on elements. For example, the
  {{HTMLElement/click()}} method on the {{HTMLElement}} interface is defined as firing a
  <code>click</code> event on the element. [[!UIEVENTS]]

  <dfn lt="firing a simple event named e|firing a simple event">Firing a simple event named
  <var>e</var></dfn> means that a <a>trusted</a> event with the name <var>e</var>, which does not
  bubble (except where otherwise stated) and is not cancelable (except where otherwise stated), and
  which uses the {{Event}} interface, must be created and <a>dispatched</a> at the given target.

  <dfn lt="Firing a synthetic mouse event named e|firing a synthetic mouse event named click">Firing a synthetic mouse event named <var>e</var></dfn>
  means that an event with the name <var>e</var>, which is <a>trusted</a> (except where otherwise
  stated), does not bubble (except where otherwise stated), is not cancelable (except where
  otherwise stated), and which uses the {{MouseEvent}} interface, must be created and <a>dispatched</a> at
  the given target. The event object must have its {{MouseEvent/screenX}}, {{MouseEvent/screenY}},
  {{MouseEvent/clientX}}, {{MouseEvent/clientY}}, and {{MouseEvent/button}} attributes initialized to
  0, its {{MouseEvent/ctrlKey}}, {{MouseEvent/shiftKey}}, {{MouseEvent/altKey}}, and
  {{MouseEvent/metaKey}} attributes initialized according to the current state of the key input
  device, if any (false for any keys that are not available), its {{UIEvent/detail}} attribute
  initialized to 1, its {{MouseEvent/relatedTarget}} attribute initialized to null (except where
  otherwise stated), and its {{UIEvent/view}} attribute initialized to the {{Window}} object of
  the {{Document}} object of the given target node, if any, or else null. The
  {{MouseEvent/getModifierState()}} method on the object must return values appropriately describing
  the state of the key input device at the time the event is created.

  <dfn lt="fire a click event|firing a click event">Firing a <code>click</code> event</dfn> means
  <a>firing a synthetic mouse event named <code>click</code></a>, which bubbles and is cancelable.

  The default action of these events is to do nothing except where otherwise stated.

<h5 id="events-and-the-window-object">Events and the <code>Window</code> object</h5>

  When an event is dispatched at a DOM node in a <code>Document</code> in a <a>browsing
  context</a>, if the event is not a <code>load</code> event, the user agent
  must act as if, for the purposes of <a>event dispatching</a>,
  the <code>Window</code> object is the parent of the <code>Document</code> object. [[!DOM]]

    </dd>
  </dl>

  <div class="example">
    Developers are strongly encouraged to use <code>self.origin</code> over
    <code>location.origin</code>. <code>self.origin</code> returns the origin of the
    environment, while <code>location.origin</code> returns URL of the environment.

    Imagine the following script executing in a document on https://example.com:

    <pre>
      var frame = document.createElement("iframe")
      frame.onload = function() {
        var frameWin = frame.contentWindow
        console.log(frameWin.location.origin) // "null"
        console.log(frameWin.origin) // "https://example.com"
      }
      document.body.appendChild(frame)
    </pre>

    <code>self.origin</code> is a more reliable security indicator.
  </div>

  The <code>origin</code> attribute's getter must return this object's relevant
  setting object's origin, serialized.

  <!-- TODO: origin and serialized references are missing. -->

<h3 id="base64-utility-methods">Base64 utility methods</h3>

  The <code>atob()</code> and <code>btoa()</code> methods allow authors to transform content to and from
  the base64 encoding.

  <p class="note">
  In these APIs, for mnemonic purposes, the "b" can be considered to stand for
  "binary", and the "a" for "ASCII". In practice, though, for primarily historical reasons, both the
  input and output of these functions are Unicode strings.

  <dl class="domintro">

    <dt><var>result</var> = <var>window</var> . <code>btoa</code>( <var>data</var> )</dt>

    <dd>

    Takes the input data, in the form of a Unicode string containing only characters in the range
    U+0000 to U+00FF, each representing a binary byte with values 0x00 to 0xFF respectively, and
    converts it to its base64 representation, which it returns.

    Throws an {{InvalidCharacterError}} exception if the input string contains any
    out-of-range characters.

    </dd>

    <dt><var>result</var> = <var>window</var> . <code>atob</code>( <var>data</var> )</dt>

    <dd>

    Takes the input data, in the form of a Unicode string containing base64-encoded binary data,
    decodes it, and returns a string consisting of characters in the range U+0000 to U+00FF, each
    representing a binary byte with values 0x00 to 0xFF respectively, corresponding to that binary
    data.

    Throws an {{InvalidCharacterError}} exception if the input string is not valid
    base64 data.

    </dd>

  </dl>

  The <dfn method for="WindowBase64"><code>btoa()</code></dfn> method must throw an
  {{InvalidCharacterError}} exception if the method's first argument contains any character
  whose code point is greater than U+00FF. Otherwise, the user agent must convert that argument to a
  sequence of octets whose <var>n</var>th octet is the eight-bit representation of the code
  point of the <var>n</var>th character of the argument, and then must apply the base64
  algorithm to that sequence of octets, and return the result. [[!RFC4648]]

  The <dfn method for="WindowBase64"><code>atob()</code></dfn> method must run the following
  steps to parse the string passed in the method's first argument:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>input</var> be the string being parsed.</li>

    <li>Let <var>position</var> be a pointer into <var>input</var>, initially

    <li>Remove all [=space characters=] from <var>input</var>.</li>

    <li>If the length of <var>input</var> divides by 4 leaving no remainder, then: if
    <var>input</var> ends with one or two U+003D EQUALS SIGN (=) characters, remove them
    from <var>input</var>.</li>

    <li>If the length of <var>input</var> divides by 4 leaving a remainder of 1, throw an

<h3 id="dynamic-markup-insertion"><dfn lt="it can also come from script|dynamic markup insertion">Dynamic markup insertion</dfn></h3>

  <p class="note">
    APIs for dynamically inserting markup into the document interact with the parser, and thus their
    behavior varies depending on whether they are used with <a>HTML documents</a> (and the
    <a>HTML parser</a>) or <a>XML documents</a> (and the <a>XML parser</a>).
  </p>

  {{Document}} objects have a <dfn>throw-on-dynamic-markup-insertion counter</dfn>, which is used in
  conjunction with the [=create an element for the token=] algorithm to prevent
  [=custom element constructors=] from being able to use {{Document/open()|document.open()}},
  {{Document/close()|document.close()}}, and {{Document/write()|document.write()}} when they are
  invoked by the parser. Initially, the counter must be set to zero.

<h4 id="opening-the-input-stream">Opening the input stream</h4>

  The
  <dfn method for="Document" id="dom-document-_open" lt="open()|open(type)|open(type, replace)|open(url, name, features)|open(url, name, features, replace)"><code>open()</code></dfn>
  method comes in several variants with different numbers of arguments.

  <dl class="domintro">
    <dt><var>document</var> = <var>document</var> . {{Document/open()|open}}( [ <var>type</var> [, <var>replace</var> ] ] )</dt>
    <dd>Causes the {{Document}} to be replaced in-place, as if it was a new {{Document}} object, but
    reusing the previous object, which is then returned.

    If the <var>type</var> argument is omitted or has the value
    "<code>[[#text-html|text/html]]</code>", then the resulting {{Document}} has an HTML
    parser associated with it, which can be given data to parse using
    {{Document/write()|document.write()}}. Otherwise, all content passed to
    {{Document/write()|document.write()}} will be parsed as plain text.

    If the <var>replace</var> argument is present and has the value "<code>replace</code>", the
    existing entries in the session history for the {{Document}} object are removed.

    The method has no effect if the {{Document}} is still being parsed.

    Throws an "{{InvalidStateError}}" {{DOMException}} if the {{Document}} is an
    <a>XML document</a>.
    </dd>

    <dd>Works like the {{Window/open()|window.open()}} method.</dd>
  </dl>

  {{Document}} objects have an <dfn>ignore-opens-during-unload counter</dfn>, which is used to
  prevent scripts from invoking the {{Document/open()|document.open()}} method (directly or
  indirectly) while the document is <a>being unloaded</a>. Initially, the counter must be set to
  zero.

  When called with two arguments (or fewer), the {{Document/open()|document.open()}} method must act
  as follows:

  1. If the {{Document}} object is an <a>XML document</a>, then throw an "{{InvalidStateError}}"
      {{DOMException}} and abort these steps.
  2. If the {{Document}} object is not an <a>active document</a>, then abort these steps.
  3. If the [=concept/origin=] of the {{Document}} is not equal to the
      [=concept/origin=] of the <a>responsible document</a> specified by the
      <a>entry settings object</a>, throw a "{{SecurityError}}" {{DOMException}} and abort these
      steps.
  4. Let <var>type</var> be the value of the first argument.
  5. If the second argument is an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for the value
      "<code>replace</code>", then let <var>replace</var> be true.

      Otherwise, if the <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>session history</a> contains only one
      {{Document}}, and that was the <a scheme><code>about:blank</code></a> {{Document}} created
      when the <a>browsing context</a> was <a lt="create a new browsing context">created</a>, and
      that {{Document}} has never had the <a>unload a document</a> algorithm invoked on it (e.g.,
      by a previous call to {{Document/open()|document.open()}}), then let <var>replace</var> be
      true.

      Otherwise, let <var>replace</var> be false.
  6. If the {{Document}} has an <a>active parser</a> whose <a>script nesting level</a> is greater
      than zero, then the method does nothing. Abort these steps and return the {{Document}} object
      on which the method was invoked.

      <p class="note">This basically causes {{Document/open()|document.open()}} to be ignored when
      it's called in an inline script found during parsing, while still letting it have an effect
      when called from a non-parser task such as a timer callback or event handler.</p>
  7. Similarly, if the {{Document}}'s <a>ignore-opens-during-unload counter</a> is greater than
      zero, then the method does nothing. Abort these steps and return the {{Document}} object on
      which the method was invoked.

      <p class="note">This basically causes {{Document/open()|document.open()}} to be ignored when
      it's called from a <code>beforeunload</code> <code>pagehide</code>, or <code>unload</code>
      event handler while the {{Document}} is being unloaded.</p>
  8. Set the {{Document}}'s <i>salvageable</i> state to false.
  9. <a>Prompt to unload</a> the {{Document}} object. If the user
      <a>refused to allow the document to be unloaded</a>, then abort these steps and return the
      {{Document}} object on which the method was invoked.
  10. <a>Unload</a> the {{Document}} object, with the <var>recycle</var> parameter set to true.
  11. <a>Abort</a> the {{Document}}.
  12. Unregister all event listeners registered on the {{Document}} node and its descendants.
  13. Remove any <a>tasks</a> associated with the {{Document}} in any <a>task source</a>.
  14. Remove all child nodes of the document, without firing any mutation events.
  15. Call the JavaScript <a>InitializeHostDefinedRealm</a>() abstract operation with the following
       customizations:

       * For the global object, create a new {{Window}} object <var>window</var>.
       * For the global <em>this</em> value, use the current <a>browsing context</a>'s associated
          {{WindowProxy}}.
       * Let <var>realm execution context</var> be the created <a>JavaScript execution context</a>.
  16. Set <var>window</var>'s
       <a lt="document associated with a window">associated <code>Document</code></a> to the
       {{Document}}.
  17. <a>Set up a browsing context environment settings object</a> with
       <var>realm execution context</var>.
  18. Replace the {{Document}}'s singleton objects with new instances of those objects, created in
       <var>window</var>'s <a>Realm</a>. (This includes in particular the
       {{History}} and {{Navigator}} objects, the various {{BarProp}}
       objects, the two <code>Storage</code> objects, the various {{HTMLCollection}} objects, and
       objects defined by other specifications, like <code>Selection</code>. It also includes all
       the Web IDL prototypes in the JavaScript binding, including the {{Document}} object's
       prototype.)
  19. Change the <a>document's character encoding</a> to UTF-8.
  20. If the {{Document}} is [=ready for post-load tasks=], then set the {{Document}} object's
       <a>reload override flag</a> and set the {{Document}}'s <a>reload override buffer</a> to the
       empty string.
  21. Set the {{Document}}'s <i>salvageable</i> state back to true.
  22. Change the document's [=document url|URL=] to the [=document url|URL=] of the
       <a>responsible document</a> specified by the <a>entry settings object</a>.
  23. If the {{Document}}'s <a>iframe load in progress</a> flag is set, set the {{Document}}'s
       <a>mute iframe load</a> flag.
  24. Create a new <a>HTML parser</a> and associate it with the document. This is a
       <dfn>script-created parser</dfn> (meaning that it can be closed by the
       {{Document/open()|document.open()}} and {{Document/close()|document.close()}} methods, and
       that the tokenizer will wait for an explicit call to {{Document/close()|document.close()}}
       before emitting an end-of-file token). The encoding <a>confidence</a> is <i>irrelevant</i>.
  25. Set the <a>current document readiness</a> of the document to "<code>loading</code>".
  26. If <var>type</var> is an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for the string
       "<code>replace</code>", then, for historical reasons, set it to the string
       "<code>[[#text-html|text/html]]</code>".

       Otherwise:

       If the <var>type</var> string contains a U+003B SEMICOLON character (;), remove the first
       such character and all characters from it up to the end of the string.

       <a>Strip leading and trailing white space</a> from <var>type</var>.
  27. If <var>type</var> is <em>not</em> now an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for the string
       "<code>[[#text-html|text/html]]</code>", then act as if the tokenizer had emitted a
       start tag token with the tag name "pre" followed by a single U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character,
       then switch the <a>HTML parser</a>'s tokenizer to the [[#plaintext-state]].
  28. Remove all the entries in the <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>session history</a> after the
       <a>current entry</a>. If the <a>current entry</a> is the last entry in the session history,
       then no entries are removed.

       <p class="note">This <a>doesn't necessarily have to affect</a> the user agent's user
       interface.</p>
  29. Remove any <a>tasks</a> queued by the <a>history traversal task source</a> that are associated
       with any {{Document}} objects in the <a>top-level browsing context</a>'s
       <a>document family</a>.
  30. Remove any earlier entries that share the same {{Document}}.
  31. If <var>replace</var> is false, then add a new entry, just before the last entry, and
       associate with the new entry the text that was parsed by the previous parser associated with
       the {{Document}} object, as well as the state of the document at the start of these steps.
       This allows the user to step backwards in the session history to see the page before it was
       blown away by the {{Document/open()|document.open()}} call. This new entry does not have a
       {{Document}} object, so a new one will be created if the session history is traversed to that
       entry.
  32. Set the {{Document}}'s <a>fired unload</a> flag to false. (It could have been set to true
       during the unload step above.)
  33. Finally, set the <a>insertion point</a> to point at just before the end of the
       <a>input stream</a> (which at this point will be empty).
  34. Return the {{Document}} on which the method was invoked.

  <p class="note">The {{Document/open()|document.open()}} method does not affect whether a
  {{Document}} is [=ready for post-load tasks=] or <a>completely loaded</a>.</p>

  When called with four arguments, the {{Document/open()}} method on the {{Document}} object must
  call the {{Window/open()}} method on the {{Window}} object of the {{Document}} object, with the
  same arguments as the original call to the {{Document/open()}} method, and return whatever that
  method returned. If the {{Document}} object has no {{Window}} object, then the method must throw
  an "{{InvalidAccessError}}" {{DOMException}}.

<h4 id="closing-the-input-stream">Closing the input stream</h4>

  The <dfn method for="Document"><code>close()</code></dfn> method must run the following steps:

  1. If the {{Document}} object is an <a>XML document</a>, then throw an {{InvalidStateError}}
      exception and abort these steps.
  2. If there is no <a>script-created parser</a> associated with the document, then abort these
      steps.
  3. Insert an <a>explicit "EOF" character</a> at the end of the parser's <a>input stream</a>.
  4. If there is a <a>pending parsing-blocking script</a>, then abort these steps.
  5. Run the tokenizer, processing resulting tokens as they are emitted, and stopping when the

      In general, adds the given string(s) to the <code>Document</code>'s input stream.

      <p class="warning">
        This method has very idiosyncratic behavior. In some cases, this method can affect the state
        of the <a>HTML parser</a> while the parser is running, resulting in a DOM that does not
        correspond to the source of the document (e.g., if the string written is the string
        "<code>&lt;plaintext&gt;</code>" or "<code>&lt;!--</code>"). In other cases, the call can
        clear the current page first, as if <code>document.open()</code> had been called. In yet
        more cases, the method is simply ignored, or throws an exception. To make matters worse, the
        exact behavior of this method can in some cases be dependent on network latency, which can
        lead to failures that are very hard to debug. <strong>For all these reasons, use of this
        method is strongly discouraged.</strong>

        This method throws an {{InvalidStateError}} exception when invoked on
        <a>XML documents</a>.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <code>Document</code> objects have an <dfn>ignore-destructive-writes counter</dfn>, which is
  used in conjunction with the processing of <{script}> elements to prevent external
  scripts from being able to use {{Document/write()|document.write()}} to blow
  away the document by implicitly calling <code>document.open()</code>.
  Initially, the counter must be set to zero.

  The <dfn method for="Document" lt="write()"><code>document.write(...)</code></dfn> method must act as
  follows:

  <ol>

    <li>

    If the method was invoked on an <a>XML document</a>, throw an
    {{InvalidStateError}} exception and abort these steps.

    </li>

    <li>If the <code>Document</code> object is not an <a>active document</a>, then abort
    these steps.</li>

    <li>

    If the <a>insertion point</a> is undefined and either the <code>Document</code>'s
    <a>ignore-opens-during-unload counter</a> is greater than zero or the
    <code>Document</code>'s <a>ignore-destructive-writes counter</a> is greater than zero,
    abort these steps.

    </li>

    <li>

    If the <a>insertion point</a> is undefined, call the <code>open()</code> method on the <code>document</code>
    object (with no arguments). If the user <a>refused to allow the document to be unloaded</a>, then abort these steps. Otherwise, the <a>insertion point</a> will point
    at just before the end of the (empty) <a>input stream</a>.

    </li>

    <li>

    Insert the string consisting of the concatenation of all the arguments to the method into the
    <a>input stream</a> just before the <a>insertion point</a>.

    </li>

    <li>

    If the <code>Document</code> object's <a>reload override flag</a> is set, then append
    the string consisting of the concatenation of all the arguments to the method to the
    <code>Document</code>'s <a>reload override buffer</a>.

    </li>

    <li>

    If there is no <a>pending parsing-blocking script</a>, have the <a>HTML
    parser</a> process the characters that were inserted, one at a time, processing resulting
    tokens as they are emitted, and stopping when the tokenizer reaches the insertion point or when
    the processing of the tokenizer is aborted by the tree construction stage (this can happen if a
    <code>script</code> end tag token is emitted by the tokenizer).

    <p class="note">
  If the {{Document/write()|document.write()}} method was
    called from script executing inline (i.e., executing because the parser parsed a set of
    <code>script</code> tags), then this is a <a lt="reentrant">reentrant invocation of the
    parser</a>.

    </li>

    <li>

    Finally, return from the method.

  </dl>

  The <dfn method for="Document" lt="writeln()"><code>document.writeln(...)</code></dfn> method, when

  <p class="note">Timers can be nested; after five such nested timers, however, the interval is

  Objects that implement the <code>WindowTimers</code> interface have a <dfn>list of active
  timers</dfn>. Each entry in this lists is identified by a number, which must be unique within the
  list for the lifetime of the object that implements the <code>WindowTimers</code> interface.

  <hr />

  The <dfn method for="WindowTimers"><code>setTimeout()</code></dfn> method must return
  the value returned by the <a>timer initialization steps</a>, passing them the method's
  arguments, the object on which the method for which the algorithm is running is implemented (a
  <code>Window</code> or <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code> object) as the <var>method
  context</var>, and the <var>repeat</var> flag set to false.

  The <dfn method for="WindowTimers"><code>setInterval()</code></dfn> method must
  return the value returned by the <a>timer initialization steps</a>, passing them the
  method's arguments, the object on which the method for which the algorithm is running is
  implemented (a <code>Window</code> or <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code> object) as the <var>method context</var>, and the <var>repeat</var> flag set to true.

  The <dfn method for="WindowTimers"><code>clearTimeout()</code></dfn> and <dfn method for="WindowTimers"><code>clearInterval()</code></dfn> methods must clear the
  entry identified as <var>handle</var> from the <a>list of active timers</a> of the
  <code>WindowTimers</code> object on which the method was invoked, if any, where <var>handle</var> is the argument passed to the method. (If <var>handle</var> does
  not identify an entry in the <a>list of active timers</a> of the <code>WindowTimers</code>
  object on which the method was invoked, the method does nothing.)

  <p class="note">
  Because <code>clearTimeout()</code> and
  <code>clearInterval()</code> clear entries from the same

    Optionally, wait a further user-agent defined length of time.

    <p class="note">
  This is intended to allow user agents to pad timeouts as needed to optimize the
    power usage of the device. For example, some processors have a low-power mode where the
    granularity of timers is reduced; on such platforms, user agents can slow timers down to fit
    this schedule instead of requiring the processor to use the more accurate mode with its

  When the <dfn method for="Window"><code>print()</code></dfn> method is invoked, if the

  run the <a>printing steps</a> <a>in parallel</a>. Otherwise, the user agent must only set the

  User agents should also run the <a>printing steps</a> whenever the user asks for the
  opportunity to <a>obtain a physical form</a> (e.g., printed copy), or the representation of a
  physical form (e.g., PDF copy), of a document.

  The <dfn>printing steps</dfn> are as follows:

  <ol>

    <li>

    The user agent may display a message to the user or abort these steps (or both).

    <p class="example">
  For instance, a kiosk browser could silently ignore any invocations of the
    <code>print()</code> method.
  </p>

    <p class="example">
  For instance, a browser on a mobile device could detect that there are no
    printers in the vicinity and display a message saying so before continuing to offer a "save to
    PDF" option.
  </p>

    </li>

    <li>

      If the <a>active sandboxing flag set</a> of the <a>active document</a> of
      the <a>responsible browsing context</a> specified by the <a>incumbent settings
      object</a> has the <a>sandboxed modals flag</a> set, then abort these
      steps.

      <p class="note">
  If the printing dialog is blocked by a <code>Document</code>'s sandbox,
      then neither the <code>beforeprint</code> nor <code>afterprint</code> events will be fired.
  </p>

    </li>

    <li>

    The user agent must <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>beforeprint</code> at the <code>Window</code> object of the
    <code>Document</code> that is being printed, as well as any <a>nested browsing contexts</a> in it.

    <p class="example">
  The <code>beforeprint</code> event can be used to
    annotate the printed copy, for instance adding the time at which the document was printed.
  </p>

    </li>

    <li>

    The user agent should offer the user the opportunity to <a>obtain a physical form</a>
    (or the representation of a physical form) of the document. The user agent may wait for the user
    to either accept or decline before returning; if so, the user agent must <a state for="useragent">pause</a>
    while the method is waiting. Even if the user agent doesn't wait at this point, the user agent
    must use the state of the relevant documents as they are at this point in the algorithm if and
    when it eventually creates the alternate form.

    </li>

    <li>

    The user agent must <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>afterprint</code> at the <code>Window</code> object of the
    <code>Document</code> that is being printed, as well as any <a>nested browsing contexts</a> in it.

    <p class="example">
  The <code>afterprint</code> event can be used to
    revert annotations added in the earlier event, as well as showing post-printing UI. For
    instance, if a page is walking the user through the steps of applying for a home loan, the
    script could automatically advance to the next step after having printed a form or other.

  The <dfn attribute for="Window"><code>navigator</code></dfn> attribute of the

      // objects implementing this interface also implement the interfaces given below
    };
    Navigator implements NavigatorID;
    Navigator implements NavigatorLanguage;
    Navigator implements NavigatorOnLine;
    Navigator implements NavigatorContentUtils;
    Navigator implements NavigatorCookies;

    preferred language first. The same object must be returned until the user agent needs to return
    different values, or values in a different order. [[!BCP47]]

    Whenever the user agent needs to make the <code>navigator.languages</code> attribute of a <code>Window</code>
    or <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code> object return a new set of language tags, the user agent must
    <a>queue a task</a> to <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>languagechange</code> at the <code>Window</code> or

  To determine <dfn lt="plausible languages|a plausible language">a plausible language</dfn>, the user agent should bear in mind the following:

  <ul>

    <li>Any information in this API that varies from user to user can be used to profile or identify
    the user.

    </li>

    <li>If the user is not using a service that obfuscates the user's point of origin (e.g., the Tor
    anonymity network), then the value that is least likely to distinguish the user from other users
    with similar origins (e.g., from the same IP address block) is the language used by the majority
    of such users. [[TOR]]</li>

    <li>If the user is using an anonymizing service, then the value "<code>en-US</code>" is
    suggested; if all users of the service use that same value, that reduces the possibility of
    distinguishing the users from each other.</li>

  </ul>

  To avoid introducing any more fingerprinting vectors, user agents should use the same list for
  the APIs defined in this function as for the HTTP <a http-header><code>Accept-Language</code></a> header.

  The <dfn lt="a registered handler"></dfn><dfn method for="NavigatorContentUtils" title="registerProtocolHandler(scheme, url, title)">registerProtocolHandler(DOMString scheme, DOMString url, DOMString title)</dfn> method
  allows Web sites to register themselves as possible handlers for particular schemes. For example,
  an online telephone messaging service could register itself as a handler of the <code>sms:</code> scheme, so that if the user clicks on such a link, he is given the
  opportunity to use that Web site. Analogously, the <dfn method for="NavigatorContentUtils" title="registerContentHandler(mimeType, url, title)">registerContentHandler(DOMString mimeType, DOMString url, DOMString title)</dfn> method allows
  Web sites to register themselves as possible handlers for content in a particular <a>MIME

  information stored on vCards that he opens. [[!RFC5724]] [[!RFC6350]]

    Registers a handler for the given scheme or content type, at the given URL, with the given
    title.

    The string "<code>%s</code>" in the URL is used as a placeholder for where to put
    the URL of the content to be handled.

    Throws a "{{SecurityError}}" {{DOMException}} if the user agent blocks the registration (this
    might happen if trying to register as a handler for "http", for instance).

    Throws a "{{SyntaxError}}" {{DOMException}} if the "<code>%s</code>" string is
    missing in the URL.

  </dl>

  User agents may, within the constraints described in this section, do whatever they like when
  the methods are called. A user agent could, for instance, prompt the user and offer the user the
  opportunity to add the site to a shortlist of handlers, or make the handlers his default, or
  cancel the request. user agents could provide such a UI through modal UI or through a non-modal transient
  notification interface. user agents could also simply silently collect the information, providing it only
  when relevant to the user.

  User agents should keep track of which sites have registered handlers (even if the user has
  declined such registrations) so that the user is not repeatedly prompted with the same
  request.

  The arguments to the methods have the following meanings and corresponding implementation
  requirements. The requirements that involve throwing exceptions must be processed in the order
  given below, stopping at the first exception thrown. (So the exceptions for the first argument
  take precedence over the exceptions for the second argument.)

  <dl>

    <dt><var>scheme</var> (<code>registerProtocolHandler()</code> only)</dt>

    <dd>

    A scheme, such as "<code>mailto</code>" or "<code>web+auth</code>". The
    scheme must be compared in an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> manner by user agents for the
    purposes of comparing with the scheme part of URLs that they consider against the list of
    registered handlers.

    The <var>scheme</var> value, if it contains a colon (as in "<code>mailto:</code>"),
    will never match anything, since schemes don't contain colons.

    If the <code>registerProtocolHandler()</code>
    method is invoked with a scheme that is neither a <a>safelisted scheme</a> nor a scheme
    whose value starts with the substring "<code>web+</code>" and otherwise contains only
    <a>lowercase ASCII letters</a>, and whose length is at least five characters (including
    the "<code>web+</code>" prefix), the user agent must throw a "{{SyntaxError}}" {{DOMException}}.

    The following schemes are the <dfn>safelisted schemes</dfn>:

  This list excludes any schemes that could reasonably be expected to be supported
    inline, e.g., in an <{iframe}>, such as <code>http</code> or (more
    theoretically) <code>gopher</code>. If those were supported, they could potentially be
    used in man-in-the-middle attacks, by replacing pages that have frames with such content with
    content under the control of the protocol handler. If the user agent has native support for the
    schemes, this could further be used for cookie-theft attacks.
  </p>

    </dd>

    <dt><var>mimeType</var> (<code>registerContentHandler()</code> only)</dt>

    <dd>

    A <a>MIME type</a>, such as <code>model/vnd.flatland.3dml</code> or <code>application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml</code>. The <a>MIME type</a> must be
    compared in an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> manner by user agents for the purposes of
    comparing with MIME types of documents that they consider against the list of registered
    handlers.

    User agents must compare the given values only to the MIME type/subtype parts of content
    types, not to the complete type including parameters. Thus, if <var>mimeType</var>
    values passed to this method include characters such as commas or white space, or include MIME
    parameters, then the handler being registered will never be used.

    <p class="note">
  The type is compared to the <a>MIME type</a> used by the user agent

    If the <code>registerContentHandler()</code>

    <dt><var>url</var></dt>

    <dd>

    A string used to build the [=url/URL=] of the page that will handle the requests.

    User agents must throw a "{{SyntaxError}}" {{DOMException}} if the <var>url</var>
    argument passed to one of these methods does not contain the exact literal string
    "<code>%s</code>".

    User agents must throw a "{{SyntaxError}}" {{DOMException}} if <a>parsing</a> the <var>url</var>
    argument relative to the <a>API base URL</a> specified by the <a>entry settings object</a> is
    not successful.

    <p class="note">
    The <a>resulting URL string</a> would by definition not be a <a>valid URL</a>
    as it would include the string "<code>%s</code>" which is not a valid
    component in a URL.
  </p>

    User agents must throw a "{{SecurityError}}" {{DOMException}} if the resulting
    <a>absolute URL</a> has an <a for="url">origin</a> that differs from the
    [=concept/origin=] specified by the <a>entry settings object</a>.

    <p class="note">
  This is forcibly the case if the <code>%s</code> placeholder is in the
    scheme, host, or port parts of the URL.
  </p>

    The <a>resulting URL string</a> is the <dfn>proto-URL</dfn>. It identifies the
    handler for the purposes of the methods described below.

    When the user agent uses this handler, it must replace the first occurrence of the exact
    literal string "<code>%s</code>" in the <var>url</var> argument with an
    escaped version of the <a>absolute URL</a> of the content in question (as defined below),
    then <a>parse</a> the resulting URL, relative to the <a>API
    base URL</a> specified by the <a>entry settings object</a> at the time the <code>registerContentHandler()</code> or <code>registerProtocolHandler()</code> methods were
    invoked, and then <a>navigate</a> an appropriate <a>browsing
    context</a> to the resulting URL.

    To get the escaped version of the <a>absolute URL</a> of the content in question, the
    user agent must replace every character in that <a>absolute URL</a> that is not a
    character in the URL <a>default encode set</a> with the result of <a lt="utf-8 percent encode">UTF-8 percent encoding</a> that character.

    <div class="example">
      If the user had visited a site at <code>https://example.com/</code> that made the
      following call:

      <pre highlight="javascript">navigator.registerContentHandler('application/x-soup', 'soup?url=%s', 'SoupWeb™')</pre>

      ...and then, much later, while visiting <code>https://www.example.net/</code>,
      clicked on a link such as:

      <xmp highlight="html">
        <a href="chickenkïwi.soup">Download our Chicken Kïwi soup!</a>
      </xmp>

      ...then, assuming this <code>chickenkïwi.soup</code> file was served with the
      <a>MIME type</a> <code>application/x-soup</code>, the user agent might navigate to the
      following URL:

      <pre>https://example.com/soup?url=https://www.example.net/chickenk%C3%AFwi.soup</pre>

      This site could then fetch the <code>chickenkïwi.soup</code> file and do
      whatever it is that it does with soup (synthesize it and ship it to the user, or whatever).
    </div>

    </dd>

    <dt><var>title</var></dt>

    <dd>

    A descriptive title of the handler, which the user agent might use to remind the user what the site
    in question is.

    </dd>

  </dl>

  This section does not define how the pages registered by these methods are used, beyond the
  requirements on how to process the <var>url</var> value (see above). To some extent, the
  <a>processing model for navigating across documents</a> defines some cases
  where these methods are relevant, but in general user agents may use this information wherever they would
  otherwise consider handing content to native plugins or helper applications.

  user agents must not use registered content handlers to handle content that was returned as part of a
  non-GET transaction (or rather, as part of any non-idempotent transaction), as the remote site
  would not be able to fetch the same data.

  <hr />

  In addition to the registration methods, there are also methods for determining if particular
  handlers have been registered, and for unregistering handlers.

  <dl class="domintro">

    Returns one of the following strings describing the state of the handler given by the
    arguments:

    <dl>

      <dt><code>new</code>

      <dd>Indicates that no attempt has been made to register the given handler (or that the handler
      has been unregistered). It would be appropriate to promote the availability of the handler or
      to just automatically register the handler.

      <dt><code>registered</code>

      <dd>Indicates that the given handler has been registered or that the site is blocked from
      registering the handler. Trying to register the handler again would have no effect.

      <dt><code>declined</code>

      <dd>Indicates that the given handler has been offered but was rejected. Trying to register the

    <dd>The described handler was once registered for the given scheme or type, but the site has

    <dd>An attempt was made to register the described handler for the given scheme or type, but the

    <dd>An attempt was made to register the described handler for the given scheme or type, but the
    user has not yet been notified; however, the user might be notified if another registration
    attempt were to be made. (Maybe the last registration attempt was made while the page was in the
    background and the user closed the page without looking at it, and the user agent requires
    confirmation for this registration attempt.)

    <dd>An attempt was made to register the described handler for the given scheme or type, but the

    <h6 id="security-and-privacy">Security and privacy</h6>

      These mechanisms can introduce a number of concerns, in particular privacy concerns.

      <strong>Hijacking all Web usage.</strong> User agents should not allow schemes that are key to
      its normal operation, such as <code>http</code> or <code>https</code>, to be
      rerouted through third-party sites. This would allow a user's activities to be trivially tracked,
      and would allow user information, even in secure connections, to be collected.

      <strong>Hijacking defaults.</strong> User agents are strongly urged to not automatically change
      any defaults, as this could lead the user to send data to remote hosts that the user is not
      expecting. New handlers registering themselves should never automatically cause those sites to be
      used.

      <strong>Registration spamming.</strong> User agents should consider the possibility that a site
      will attempt to register a large number of handlers, possibly from multiple domains (e.g., by
      redirecting through a series of pages each on a different domain, and each registering a handler
      for <code>video/mpeg</code> — analogous practices abusing other Web browser features have
      been used by pornography Web sites for many years). User agents should gracefully handle such
      hostile attempts, protecting the user.

      <strong>Misleading titles.</strong> User agents should not rely wholly on the <var>title</var>
      argument to the methods when presenting the registered handlers to the user, since sites could
      easily lie. For example, a site <code>hostile.example.net</code> could claim that it was
      registering the "Cuddly Bear Happy Content Handler". User agents should therefore use the
      handler's domain in any UI along with any title.

      <strong>Hostile handler metadata.</strong> User agents should protect against typical attacks
      against strings embedded in their interface, for example ensuring that markup or escape characters
      in such strings are not executed, that null bytes are properly handled, that over-long strings do
      not cause crashes or buffer overruns, and so forth.

      <strong>Leaking Intranet URLs.</strong> The mechanism described in this section can result in
      secret Intranet URLs being leaked, in the following manner:

      <ol>

        <li>The user registers a third-party content handler as the default handler for a content
        type.</li>

        <li>The user then browses his corporate Intranet site and accesses a document that uses that
        content type.</li>

        <li>The user agent contacts the third party and hands the third party the URL to the Intranet
        content.</li>

      </ol>

      No actual confidential file data is leaked in this manner, but the URLs themselves could
      contain confidential information. For example, the URL could be <code>https://www.corp.example.com/upcoming-aquisitions/the-sample-company.egf</code>, which
      might tell the third party that Example Corporation is intending to merge with The Sample Company.
      Implementors might wish to consider allowing administrators to disable this feature for certain
      subdomains, content types, or schemes.

      <strong>Leaking secure URLs.</strong> User agents should not send HTTPS URLs to third-party
      sites registered as content handlers without the user's informed consent, for the same reason that
      user agents sometimes avoid sending <a http-header><code>Referer</code></a> (sic) HTTP
      headers from secure sites to third-party sites.

      <strong>Leaking credentials.</strong> User agents must never send username or password
      information in the URLs that are escaped and included sent to the handler sites. User agents may
      even avoid attempting to pass to Web-based handlers the URLs of resources that are known to
      require authentication to access, as such sites would be unable to access the resources in
      question without prompting the user for credentials themselves (a practice that would require the
      user to know whether to trust the third-party handler, a decision many users are unable to make or
      even understand).

      <strong>Interface interference.</strong> User agents should be prepared to handle intentionally
      long arguments to the methods. For example, if the user interface exposed consists of an "accept"
      button and a "deny" button, with the "accept" binding containing the name of the handler, it's
      important that a long name not cause the "deny" button to be pushed off the screen.

      <strong>Fingerprinting users.</strong> Since a site can detect if it has attempted to register
      a particular handler or not, whether or not the user responds, the mechanism can be used to store
      data. User agents are therefore strongly urged to treat registrations in the same manner as
      cookies: clearing cookies for a site should also clear all registrations for that site, and
      disabling cookies for a site should also disable registrations.

<h6 id="sample-user-interface">Sample user interface</h6>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  A simple implementation of this feature for a desktop Web browser might work as follows.

  The <code>registerContentHandler()</code> method
  could display a modal dialog box:

  <img src="images/sample-content-handler-registration.png" width="534" height="374" alt="The modal dialog box could have the title 'Content Handler Registration', and could say 'This Web page: Kittens at work https://kittens.example.org/ ...would like permission to handle files of type: application/x-meowmeow using the following Web-based application: Kittens-at-work displayer https://kittens.example.org/?show=%s Do you trust the administrators of the &quot;kittens.example.org&quot; domain?' with two buttons, 'Trust kittens.example.org' and 'Cancel'." />

  In this dialog box, "Kittens at work" is the title of the page that invoked the method,
  "https://kittens.example.org/" is the URL of that page, "application/x-meowmeow" is the string that
  was passed to the <code>registerContentHandler()</code> method as its first
  argument (<var>mimeType</var>), "https://kittens.example.org/?show=%s" was the second
  argument (<var>url</var>), and "Kittens-at-work displayer" was the third argument (<var>title</var>).

  If the user clicks the Cancel button, then nothing further happens. If the user clicks the
  "Trust" button, then the handler is remembered.

  When the user then attempts to fetch a URL that uses the "application/x-meowmeow" <a>MIME
  type</a>, then it might display a dialog as follows:

  <img src="images/sample-content-handler.png" width="577" height="428" alt="The dialog box could have the title 'Unknown File Type' and could say 'You have attempted to access:' followed by a URL, followed by a prompt such as 'How would you like FerretBrowser to handle this resource?' with three radio buttons, one saying 'Contact the FerretBrowser plugin registry to see if there is an official way to handle this resource.', one saying 'Pass this URL to a local application' with an application selector, and one saying 'Pass this URL to the &quot;Kittens-at-work displayer&quot; application at &quot;kittens.example.org&quot;', with a checkbox labeled 'Always do this for resources using the &quot;application/x-meowmeow&quot; type in future.', and with two buttons, 'Ok' and 'Cancel'." />

  In this dialog, the third option is the one that was primed by the site registering itself
  earlier.

  If the user does select that option, then the browser, in accordance with the requirements
  described in the previous two sections, will redirect the user to
  "https://kittens.example.org/?show=data%3Aapplication/x-meowmeow;base64,S2l0dGVucyBhcmUgdGhlIGN1dGVzdCE%253D".

  The <code>registerProtocolHandler()</code> method
  would work equivalently, but for schemes instead of unknown content types.

  An <code>ImageBitmap</code> object represents a bitmap image that can be painted to a canvas
  without undue latency.

  <p class="note">
  The exact judgement of what is undue latency of this is left up to the
  implementer, but in general if making use of the bitmap requires network I/O, or even local disk
  I/O, then the latency is probably undue; whereas if it only requires a blocking read from a GPU or
  system RAM, the latency is probably acceptable.

    Takes <var>image</var>, which can be an <{img}> element,
    <{video}>, or <{canvas}> element, a <code>Blob</code> object, an
    <code>ImageData</code> object, a <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code> object, or another
    <code>ImageBitmap</code> object, and returns a promise that is resolved when a new
    <code>ImageBitmap</code> is created.

    If no <code>ImageBitmap</code> object can be constructed, for example because the provided
    <var>image</var> data is not actually an image, then the promise is rejected instead.

    If <var>sx</var>, <var>sy</var>, <var>sw</var>, and <var>sh</var> arguments are provided, the source image is cropped to the given pixels, with
    any pixels missing in the original replaced by transparent black. These coordinates are in the
    source image's pixel coordinate space, <em>not</em> in CSS pixels.

    Rejects the promise with an {{InvalidStateError}} exception if the source image is not in a valid
    state (e.g., an <{img}> element that hasn't finished loading, or a
    <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code> object whose bitmap data has zero length along one or both
    dimensions, or an <code>ImageData</code> object whose data is <code>data</code> attribute has been neutered). Rejects the promise with a "{{SyntaxError}}" {{DOMException}} if the script is not allowed to access the image data of the source image (e.g., a
    <code>video</code> that is <a>CORS-cross-origin</a>, or a <code>canvas</code> being drawn
    on by a script in a worker from another [=concept/origin=]).

    An <code>ImageBitmap</code> object always has associated <dfn>bitmap data</dfn>, with a width and a height.
    However, it is possible for this data to be corrupted. If an <code>ImageBitmap</code> object's
    media data can be decoded without errors, it is said to be <a>fully decodable</a>.


    An <code>ImageBitmap</code> object's bitmap has an <a>origin-clean</a> flag, which indicates whether the
    bitmap is tainted by content from a different [=concept/origin=]. The flag is initially set to
    true and may be changed to false by the steps of <code>createImageBitmap()</code>.
