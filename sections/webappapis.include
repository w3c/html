<h4 id="scripting-introduction">Introduction</h4>

  Various mechanisms can cause author-provided executable code to run in the context of a
  document. These mechanisms include, but are probably not limited to:

  <ul>

    <li>Processing of <{script}> elements.</li>

    <li>Navigating to <a><code>javascript:</code> URLs</a>.</li>

    <li>Event handlers, whether registered through the DOM using <code>addEventListener()</code>, by explicit <a>event handler content attributes</a>, by
    <a>event handler IDL attributes</a>, or otherwise.</li>

    <li>Processing of technologies like SVG that have their own scripting features.</li>

  </ul>

<h4 id="enabling-and-disabling-scripting">Enabling and disabling scripting</h4>

  <dfn lt="scripting was enabled|scripting is enabled">Scripting is enabled</dfn> in a <em><a>browsing

  <ul>

    <li>The user agent supports scripting.</li>

    <li>The user has not disabled scripting for this <a>browsing context</a> at this time.
    (User agents may provide users with the option to disable scripting globally, or in a
    finer-grained manner, e.g. on a per-origin basis.)

<h4 id="scripting-processing-model">Processing model</h4>

<h5 id="processing-model-definitions">Definitions</h5>

  This specification describes three kinds of <a>JavaScript global environments</a>: the <dfn>document environment</dfn>, the
  <dfn>dedicated worker environment</dfn>, and the <dfn>shared worker environment</dfn>. The
  <a>dedicated worker environment</a> and the <a>shared worker environment</a> are both
  types of <dfn>worker environments</dfn>.

  Except where otherwise specified, a <a>JavaScript global environment</a> is a
  <a>document environment</a>.

  <hr />

  A <dfn>script</dfn> has:

  <dl>

    <dt>A <dfn>code entry-point</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    A code entry-point represents a block of executable code that the script exposes to other
    scripts and to the user agent. Typically, the code corresponding to the code entry-point is
    executed immediately after the script is parsed, but for event handlers, it is called each time
    the handler is invoked.

    <p class="example">
  In JavaScript <code>script</code> blocks, this corresponds to the execution
    context of the global code.
  </p>

    </dd>

    <dt>Optionally, a <dfn>muted errors</dfn> flag</dt>

    <dd>

    A flag which, if set, means that error information will not be provided for errors in this
    script (used to mute errors for cross-origin scripts, since that can leak private
    information).

    </dd>

    <dt>A <dfn>settings object</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    An <a>environment settings object</a>, various settings that are shared with other scripts in
    the same context.

    </dd>

  </dl>

  <hr />

  An <dfn>environment settings object</dfn> specifies algorithms for obtaining the following:

  <dl>

    <dt>A <dfn>script execution environment</dfn> for each language supported by the user agent</dt>

    <dd>

    The characteristics of the script execution environment depend on the language, and are not
    defined by this specification.

    <p class="example">
  In JavaScript, the script execution environment consists of the interpreter,
    the stack of <i>execution contexts</i>, the <i>global code</i> and <i>function code</i> and the
    <code>Function</code> objects resulting, and so forth.
  </p>

    </dd>

    <dt>A <dfn>global object</dfn></dt>
    <dd>

    An object that provides the APIs that can be called by the code in scripts that use this
    <a>settings object</a>.

    <p class="note">
  This is typically a <code>Window</code> object or a
    <code>WorkerGlobalScope</code> object. When a <a>global object</a> is an empty object, it
    can't do anything that interacts with the environment.
  </p>

    If the <a>global object</a> is a <code>Window</code> object, then, in JavaScript, the
    ThisBinding of the global execution context for this script must be the <code>Window</code>
    object's <code>WindowProxy</code> object, rather than the global object. [[!ECMA-262]]

    <p class="note">
  This is a <a>willful violation</a> of the JavaScript specification current
    at the time of writing (ECMAScript edition 6, as defined in section 10.4.1.1 Initial Global
    Execution Context, step 3). The JavaScript specification requires that the <code>this</code> keyword in the global scope return the global object, but this is not
    compatible with the security design prevalent in implementations as specified herein. [[!ECMA-262]]
  </p>

    </dd>

    <dt>A <dfn>responsible browsing context</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    A <a>browsing context</a> that is assigned responsibility for actions taken by the
    scripts that use this <a>environment settings object</a>.

    <p class="example">
  When a script creates and <a>navigates</a> a new
    <a>top-level browsing context</a>, the <code>opener</code> attribute
    of the new <a>browsing context</a>'s <code>Window</code> object will be set to the
    <a>responsible browsing context</a>'s <code>WindowProxy</code> object.
  </p>

    </dd>

    <dt>A <dfn>responsible event loop</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    An <a>event loop</a> that is used when it would not be immediately clear what event
    loop to use.

    </dd>

    <dt>A <dfn>responsible document</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    A <code>Document</code> that is assigned responsibility for actions taken by the scripts that
    use this <a>environment settings object</a>.

    <p class="example">
  For example, the <a>address</a> of the
    <a>responsible document</a> is used to set the <a>address</a> of the {{Document}} after it has been reset using <code>document.open()</code>.
  </p>

    If the <a>responsible event loop</a> is not a <a>browsing context</a> <a>event loop</a>,
    then the <a>environment settings object</a> has no <a>responsible document</a>.

    </dd>

    <dt>An <dfn>API URL character encoding</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    A character encoding used to encode URLs by APIs called by scripts that use this <a>environment
    settings object</a>.

    </dd>

    <dt>An <dfn>API base URL</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    An <a>absolute URL</a> used by APIs called by scripts that use this <a>environment
    settings object</a> to resolve <a>relative URLs</a>.

    </dd>

    <dt>An <a spec="fetch">origin</a> and an <a>effective script origin</a></dt>

    <dd>

    An instrument used in security checks.

    </dd>

    <dt>A <dfn>creation URL</dfn></dt>

    <dd>
    An <a>absolute URL</a> representing the location of the resource with which the
    <a>environment settings object</a> is associated. Note that this URL might be distinct
    from the <a>responsible document</a>'s <a>address</a>, due to mechanisms such as <code>history.pushState()</code>.
    </dd>

    <dt>An <a spec="fetch">HTTPS state</a></dt>

    <dd>
    A value representing the security properties of the network channel used to deliver the
    resource with which the <a>environment settings object</a> is associated. The value will
    be one of "<code>modern</code>", "<code>deprecated</code>", or
    "<code>none</code>".

    <p class="note">
  Resources delivered over HTTPS will generally have an <a spec="fetch">HTTPS state</a>
    of "<code>modern</code>". A user agent can use "<code>deprecated</code>"
    during transitional periods where rejecting the response entirely would be inappropriate (e.g.,
    while removing support for a hash function or cypher suite).
  </p>
    </dd>

  </dl>

  An <a>environment settings object</a> also has an
  <dfn>outstanding rejected promises weak set</dfn> and an
  <dfn>about-to-be-notified rejected promises list</dfn>, used to track
  <a>unhandled promise rejections</a>. The <a>outstanding rejected promises weak set</a> must not
  create strong references to any of its members, and implementations are free to limit its size,
  e.g. by removing old entries from it when new ones are added.

  The <dfn>relevant settings object for a global object</dfn> <var>o</var> is the
  <a>environment settings object</a> whose <a>global object</a> is <var>o</var>.
  (There is always a 1:1 mapping of global objects to environment settings objects.)

  The <dfn>relevant settings object for a script</dfn> <var>s</var> is the
  <a>settings object</a> of <var>s</var>.

<h5 id="script-settings-for-browsing-contexts">Script settings for browsing contexts</h5>

  Whenever a new <code>Window</code> object is created, the user agent must:

  <ol>
    <li>Let <var>url</var> be a copy of the <a>address</a>
    of the <code>Document</code> with which the <code>Window</code> is associated.</li>

    <li>
    Create an <a>environment settings object</a> whose algorithms are defined as
    follows:

    <dl>

      <dt>The <a>script execution environments</a></dt>
      <dd>

      When the <a>environment settings object</a> is created, for each language supported by the
      user agent, create an appropriate execution environment as defined by the relevant
      specification.

      When a <a>script execution environment</a> is needed, return the appropriate one from
      those created when the <a>environment settings object</a> was created.

<h5 id="calling-scripts">Calling scripts</h5>

  Each <a>unit of related similar-origin browsing contexts</a> has a <dfn>stack of script
  settings objects</dfn>, which must be initially empty. When a new <a>environment settings
  object</a> is <i>pushed</i> onto this stack, the specified <a>environment settings object</a>
  is to be added to the stack; when the <a>environment settings object</a> on this stack that was
  most recently pushed onto it is to be <i>popped</i> from the stack, it must be removed. Entries on
  this stack can be labeled as <dfn>candidate entry
  settings objects</dfn>.

  When a user agent is to <dfn>jump to a code entry-point</dfn> for a <a>script</a> <var>s</var>, given an optional <var>rethrow errors</var>
  flag, the user agent must run the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>context</var> be the <a>settings object</a> of <var>s</var>.</li>

    <li><a>Prepare to run a callback</a> with <var>context</var> as the
    <a>environment settings object</a>. If this returns "do not run" then abort these
    steps.</li>

    <li>Make the appropriate <a>script execution environment</a> specified by <var>context</var> execute the <var>s</var>'s <a>code
    entry-point</a>.</li>

    <li><a>Clean up after running a callback</a>.</li>

  </ol>

  The steps to <dfn>prepare to run a callback</dfn> with an <a>environment settings object</a>
  <var>o</var> are as follows. They return either "run" or "do not run".

  <ol>

    <li>If the <a>global object</a> specified by <var>o</var> is a
    <code>Window</code> object whose <code>Document</code> object is not <a>fully active</a>,
    then return "do not run" and abort these steps.

    <li>If <a>scripting is disabled</a> for the
    <a>responsible browsing context</a> specified by <var>o</var>, then return "do
    not run" and abort these steps.

    <li>Push <var>o</var> onto the <a>stack of script settings objects</a>, and
    label it as a <a>candidate entry settings object</a>.</li>

    <li>Return "run".</li>

  </ol>

  The steps to <dfn>clean up after running a callback</dfn> are as follows:

  <ol>

    <li>Pop the current <a>incumbent settings object</a> from the <a>stack of script
    settings objects</a>.</li>

    <li>If the <a>stack of script settings objects</a> is now empty, <a>run the global
    script clean-up jobs</a>. (These cannot run scripts.)</li>

    <li>If the <a>stack of script settings objects</a> is now empty, <a>perform a
    microtask checkpoint</a>. (If this runs scripts, these algorithms will be invoked
    reentrantly.)</li>

  </ol>

  <p class="note">
  These algorithms are not invoked by one script directly calling another, but they
  can be invoked reentrantly in an indirect manner, e.g. if a script dispatches an event which has
  event listeners registered.
  </p>

  When a JavaScript <i>SourceElements</i> production is to be evaluated, the <a>settings
  object</a> of the <a>script</a> corresponding to that
  <i>SourceElements</i> must be pushed onto the <a>stack of script settings objects</a> before
  the evaluation begins, and popped when the evaluation ends (regardless of whether it's an abrupt
  completion or not).

  The <dfn>entry settings object</dfn> is the most-recently added <a>environment settings
  object</a> in the <a>stack of script settings objects</a> that is labeled as a
  <a>candidate entry settings object</a>. If the stack is empty, or has no entries labeled as
  such, then there is no <a>entry settings object</a>. It is used to obtain, amongst other
  things, the <a>API base URL</a> to <a>resolve</a> relative
  <a for="url">URLs</a> used in scripts running in that <a>unit of related
  similar-origin browsing contexts</a>.

  The <dfn>incumbent settings object</dfn> is the <a>environment settings object</a> in the
  <a>stack of script settings objects</a> that was most-recently added (i.e. the last one on
  the stack). If the stack is empty, then there is no <a>incumbent settings object</a>. It is
  used in some security checks.

  <p class="note">
  The Web IDL specification also uses these algorithms. [[!WEBIDL]]
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    Consider the following two pages, with the first being loaded in a browser window and the
    second being loaded in the <code>iframe</code> of the first:

    <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;!-- a/a.html -->
  &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>
  &lt;title>Outer page&lt;/title>
  &lt;iframe src="../b/b.html">&lt;/iframe>
  &lt;input type=button onclick="frames[0].hello()" value="Hello">
  </pre>

    <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;!-- b/b.html -->
  &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>
  &lt;title>Inner page&lt;/title>
  &lt;script>
  function hello() {
    location.assign('c.html');
  }
  &lt;/script>
  </pre>

    When the button is pressed in the inner frame, the outer page runs script in the inner page.
    While the <code>hello()</code> function is running, the <a>entry settings
    object</a> is that of the outer file (<code>a/a.html</code>), and the
    <a>incumbent settings object</a> is that of the inner file (<code>b/b.html</code>). The <code>assign()</code> method uses
    the <a>entry settings object</a> to resolve the URL, so we end up loading <code>a/c.html</code>, but it uses the <a>incumbent settings object</a> to establish
    the <a>source browsing context</a>, from which the referrer is established, so the <code>Referer</code> header sent with the request for <code>a/c.html</code> specifies the inner file's URL (the one ending with <code>b/b.html</code>).
  </div>

  <hr />

  Each <a>unit of related similar-origin browsing contexts</a> has a <dfn>global script
  clean-up jobs list</dfn>, which must initially be empty. A global script clean-up job cannot run
  scripts, and cannot be sensitive to the order in which other clean-up jobs are executed. The File
  API uses this to release <a scheme><code>blob:</code></a> URLs. [[!FILEAPI]]

  When the user agent is to <dfn>run the global script clean-up jobs</dfn>, the user agent must
  perform each of the jobs in the <a>global script clean-up jobs list</a> and then empty the
  list.

  </div>

  <div class="impl">

<h5 id="sec-creating-scripts"><dfn lt="create a script|creating scripts">Creating scripts</dfn></h5>

  When the specification says that a <a>script</a> is to be <i>created</i>, given some script source, a script source URL, its
  scripting language, an <a>environment settings object</a>, and optionally a <var>muted
  errors</var> flag, the user agent must run the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>script</var> be a new <a>script</a> that
    this algorithm will subsequently initialize.</li>

    <li>If <a>scripting is disabled</a> for <a>browsing
    context</a> passed to this algorithm, then abort these steps, as if the script source
    described a program that did nothing but return void.

    <li>Obtain the appropriate <a>script execution environment</a> for the given scripting
    language from the <a>environment settings object</a> provided.</li>

    <li>Parse/compile/initialize the source of the script using the <a>script execution
    environment</a>, as appropriate for the scripting language, and thus obtain <var>script</var>'s <a>code entry-point</a>.</li>

    <li>Let <var>script</var>'s <a>settings object</a> be the <a>environment
    settings object</a> provided.</li>

    <li>If the <var>muted errors</var> flag was set, then set <var>script</var>'s <a>muted errors</a> flag.</li>

    <li>

    If all the steps above succeeded (in particular, if the script was compiled successfully),
    Jump to <var>script</var>'s <a>code
    entry-point</a>.

    Otherwise, report the error for <var>script</var>, with the
    problematic position (line number and column number), using the <a>global object</a>
    specified by the <a>environment settings object</a> as the target. If the error is still <i>not handled</i> after this, then the error may be reported to
    a developer console.

    </li>

  </ol>

  </div>

  <div class="impl">

<h5 id="killing-scripts">Killing scripts</h5>

  User agents may impose resource limitations on scripts, for example CPU quotas, memory limits,
  total execution time limits, or bandwidth limitations. When a script exceeds a limit, the user
  agent may either throw a <code>QuotaExceededError</code> exception, abort the script without an
  exception, prompt the user, or throttle script execution.

  <div class="example">
    For example, the following script never terminates. A user agent could, after waiting for a
    few seconds, prompt the user to either terminate the script or let it continue.

    <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;script>
  while (true) { /* loop */ }
  &lt;/script>
  </pre>
  </div>

  User agents are encouraged to allow users to disable scripting whenever the user is prompted
  either by a script (e.g. using the <code>window.alert()</code> API) or because
  of a script's actions (e.g. because it has exceeded a time limit).

  If scripting is disabled while a script is executing, the script should be terminated
  immediately.

  User agents may allow users to specifically disable scripts just for the purposes of closing a
  <a>browsing context</a>.

  <p class="example">
  For example, the prompt mentioned in the example above could also offer the
  user with a mechanism to just close the page entirely, without running any <code>unload</code> event handlers.
  </p>

<h5 id="integration-with-the-javascript-job-queue">Integration with the JavaScript job queue</h5>

  The JavaScript specification defines the JavaScript job and job queue abstractions in order to
  specify certain invariants about how promise operations execute with a clean <a>JavaScript
  execution context stack</a> and in a certain order. However, as of the time of this writing
  the definitions of <a>EnqueueJob</a> and <a>NextJob</a> in that specification are not sufficiently flexible to
  integrate with HTML as a host environment. [[!ECMA-262]]

  <p class="note">
    This is not strictly true. It is in fact possible, by taking liberal advantage of
    the many "implementation defined" sections of those algorithms, to contort them to our purposes.
    However, the end result is a mass of messy indirection and workarounds that essentially bypasses
    the job queue infrastructure entirely, albeit in a way that is technically sanctioned within the
    bounds of implementation-defined behavior. We do not take this path, and instead introduce the
    following <a>willful violations</a>.
  </p>

  As such, user agents must instead use the following definitions in place of those in the
  JavaScript specification. These ensure that the promise jobs enqueued by the JavaScript
  specification are properly integrated into the user agent's <a>event
  loops</a>.

<h6 id="enqueusjob"><dfn>EnqueueJob</dfn>(<var>queueName</var>, <var>job</var>, <var>arguments</var>)</h6>

  When the JavaScript specification says to call the EnqueueJob abstract operation, the
  following algorithm must be used in place of JavaScript's <a>EnqueueJob</a>:

  <ol>
   <li>Assert: <var>queueName</var> is <code>"PromiseJobs"</code>. (<code>"ScriptJobs"</code> must not be used by user agents.)</li>
   <li>Let <var>settings</var> be the <a>settings object</a> of the script corresponding to the running execution context.</li>
   <li>
    <a>Queue a microtask</a>, on <var>settings</var>'s <a>responsible event

    handler content attributes</a>; or the JavaScript file that the script was in, for external
    scripts. Even for dynamically-generated scripts, user agents are strongly encouraged to attempt
    to keep track of the original source of a script. For example, if an external script uses the
    <a method lt="write()"><code>document.write()</code></a> API to insert an inline
    <{script}> element during parsing, the URL of the resource containing the script would
    ideally be reported as being the external script, and the line number might ideally be reported
    as the line with the <a method lt="write()"><code>document.write()</code></a> call or where the
    string passed to that call was first constructed. Naturally, implementing this can be somewhat
    non-trivial.
  </p>

    <p class="note">
  User agents are similarly encouraged to keep careful track of the original line

<h4 id="event-loops">Event loops</h4>

<h5 id="event-loops-definitions">Definitions</h5>

  To coordinate events, user interaction, scripts, rendering, networking, and so forth, user
  agents must use <dfn lt="event loop|event loops">event loops</dfn> as described in this section. There are
  two kinds of event loops: those for <a>browsing contexts</a>, and
  those for {{worker|workers}}.

  There must be at least one <a>browsing context</a> <a>event loop</a> per user
  agent, and at most one per <a>unit of related similar-origin browsing contexts</a>.

  <p class="note">
  When there is more than one <a>event loop</a> for a <a>unit of related
  browsing contexts</a>, complications arise when a <a>browsing context</a> in that group
  is <a>navigated</a> such that it switches from one <a>unit of related
  similar-origin browsing contexts</a> to another. This specification does not currently describe
  how to handle these complications.
  </p>

  A <a>browsing context</a> <a>event loop</a> always has at least one <a>browsing
  context</a>. If such an <a>event loop</a>'s <a>browsing
  contexts</a> all go away, then the <a>event loop</a> goes away as well. A <a>browsing
  context</a> always has an <a>event loop</a> coordinating its activities.

  <a>Worker event loops</a> are simpler: each worker has one
  <a>event loop</a>, and the <a>worker processing model</a>
  manages the <a>event loop</a>'s lifetime.

  <hr />

  An <a>event loop</a> has one or more <dfn>task queues</dfn>. A
  <a>task queue</a> is an ordered list of <dfn>tasks</dfn>, which are
  algorithms that are responsible for such work as:

  <dl>

    <dt>Events</dt>

    <dd>

    Dispatching an <code>Event</code> object at a particular
    <code>EventTarget</code> object is often done by a dedicated task.

    <p class="note">
  Not all events are dispatched using the <a>task queue</a>, many are
    dispatched during other tasks.
  </p>

    </dd>

    <dt>Parsing</dt>

    <dd>The <a>HTML parser</a> tokenizing one or more bytes, and then processing any
    resulting tokens, is typically a task.</dd>

    <dt>Callbacks</dt>

    <dd>Calling a callback is often done by a dedicated task.</dd>

    <dt>Using a resource</dt>

    <dd>When an algorithm <a>fetches</a> a resource, if the fetching
    occurs in a non-blocking fashion then the processing of the resource once some or all of the
    resource is available is performed by a task.</dd>

    <dt>Reacting to DOM manipulation</dt>

    <dd>Some elements have tasks that trigger in response to DOM manipulation, e.g. when that
    element is <a for="document">inserted into the document</a>.

  </dl>

  Each <a>task</a> in a <a>browsing context</a> <a>event loop</a> is associated with a <code>Document</code>; if the task was queued in the context of
  an element, then it is the element's <a>node document</a>; if the task was queued in the context
  of a <a>browsing context</a>, then it is the <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>active
  document</a> at the time the task was queued; if the task was queued by or for a <a>script</a> then the document is the <a>responsible document</a>
  specified by the script's <a>settings object</a>.

  A <a>task</a> is intended for a specific <a>event loop</a>:
  the <a>event loop</a> that is handling <a>tasks</a> for the
  <a>task</a>'s associated <code>Document</code> or {{worker}}.

  When a user agent is to <dfn lt="queuing|queue a task|queues a task">queue a task</dfn>, it must add the given task to one of the <a>task queues</a> of the relevant <a>event loop</a>.

  Each <a>task</a> is defined as coming from a specific <dfn>task
  source</dfn>. All the tasks from one particular <a>task source</a> and destined to a
  particular <a>event loop</a> (e.g. the callbacks generated by timers of a
  {{Document}}, the events fired for mouse movements over that {{Document}}, the
  tasks queued for the parser of that <code>Document</code>) must always be added to the same
  <a>task queue</a>, but <a>tasks</a> from different <a>task sources</a> may be placed in different <a>task
  queues</a>.

  <p class="example">
  For example, a user agent could have one <a>task queue</a> for mouse and
  key events (the <a>user interaction task source</a>), and another for everything else. The
  user agent could then give keyboard and mouse events preference over other tasks three quarters of
  the time, keeping the interface responsive but not starving other task queues, and never
  processing events from any one <a>task source</a> out of order.
  </p>

  Each <a>event loop</a> has a <dfn>currently running task</dfn>. Initially, this is null.
  It is used to handle reentrancy. Each <a>event loop</a> also has a <dfn>performing a
  microtask checkpoint</dfn> flag, which must initially be false. It is used to prevent reentrant
  invocation of the <a>perform a microtask checkpoint</a> algorithm.

<h5 id="event-loops-processing-model">Processing model</h5>

  An <a>event loop</a> must continually run through the following steps for as long as it
  exists:

  <ol>

    <li>

    Select the oldest <a>task</a> on one of the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>task queues</a>, if any, ignoring, in the case of a
    <a>browsing context</a> <a>event loop</a>, tasks whose associated
    <code>Document</code>s are not <a>fully active</a>. The user agent may pick any <a>task
    queue</a>. If there is no task to select, then jump to the <i>microtasks</i> step below.

    </li>

    <li>Set the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>currently running task</a> to the <a>task</a> selected in the previous step.</li>

    <li><i>Run</i>: Run the selected <a>task</a>.</li>

    <li>Set the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>currently running task</a> back to
    null.</li>

    <li>Remove the task that was run in the <i>run</i> step above from its <a>task
    queue</a>.</li>

    <li><i>Microtasks</i>: <a>Perform a microtask checkpoint</a>.</li>

    <li>

    <i>Update the rendering</i>: If this <a>event loop</a> is a <a>browsing
    context</a> <a>event loop</a> (as opposed to a {{worker}}
    <a>event loop</a>), then run the following substeps.

    <ol>

      <li>Let <var>now</var> be the value that would be returned by the <code>Performance</code>
      object's {{Performance/now|now()}} method. [[!HR-TIME-2]]

      <li>

      Let <var>docs</var> be the list of <code>Document</code> objects associated with the
      <a>event loop</a> in question, sorted arbitrarily except that the following conditions
      must be met:

      <ul>

        <li>Any <code>Document</code> <var>B</var> that is <a>nested through</a> a
        <code>Document</code> <var>A</var> must be listed after <var>A</var> in the list.</li>

        <li>If there are two documents <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> whose <a>browsing contexts</a> are both <a>nested
        browsing contexts</a> and their <a>browsing context
        containers</a> are both elements in the same <code>Document</code> <var>C</var>, then the
        order of <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> in the list must match the relative <a>tree
        order</a> of their respective <a>browsing context
        containers</a> in <var>C</var>.</li>

      </ul>

      In the steps below that iterate over <var>docs</var>, each <code>Document</code> must be
      processed in the order it is found in the list.

      </li>

      <li>

      If there is a <a>top-level browsing context</a> <var>B</var> that the user agent
      believes would not benefit from having its rendering updated at this time, then remove from
      <var>docs</var> all <code>Document</code> objects whose <a>browsing context</a>'s
      <a>top-level browsing context</a> is <var>B</var>.

      <p class="note">
  Whether a <a>top-level browsing context</a> would benefit from having
      its rendering updated depends on various factors, such as the update frequency. For example,
      if the browser is attempting to achieve a 60 Hz refresh rate, then these steps are only
      necessary every 60th of a second (about 16.7ms). If the browser finds that a <a>top-level
      browsing context</a> is not able to sustain this rate, it might drop to a more sustainable
      30Hz for that set of <code>Document</code>s, rather than occasionally dropping frames. (This
      specification does not mandate any particular model for when to update the rendering.)
      Similarly, if a <a>top-level browsing context</a> is in the background, the user agent
      might decide to drop that page to a much slower 4Hz, or even less.
  </p>

      </li>

      <li>For each <a>fully active</a> <code>Document</code> in <var>docs</var>, <dfn>run the resize steps</dfn> for
      that {{Document}}, passing in <var>now</var> as the timestamp. [[!CSSOM-VIEW]]</li>

  microtasks</a> have to take extra care to <a>wrap callbacks</a> to handle <a>spinning the event
  loop</a>.
  </p>

  When an algorithm requires a <a>microtask</a> to be <dfn lt="queue a microtask|queued">queued</dfn>, it must be appended to the relevant <a>event loop</a>'s
  <a>microtask queue</a>; the <a>task source</a> of such a <a>microtask</a> is the
  <dfn>microtask task source</dfn>.

  <p class="note">
  It is possible for a <a>microtask</a> to be moved to a regular <a>task queue</a>, if, during its
  initial execution, it <a>spins the event loop</a>. In that case, the <a>microtask task source</a>
  is the <a>task source</a> used. Normally, the <a>task source</a> of a <a>microtask</a> is
  irrelevant.
  </p>

  When a user agent is to <dfn lt="performs a microtask checkpoint|perform a microtask checkpoint">perform a microtask checkpoint</dfn>, if the <a>performing a
  microtask checkpoint</a> flag is false, then the user agent must run the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>Let the <a>performing a microtask checkpoint</a> flag be true.</li>

    <li><i>Microtask queue handling</i>: If the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>microtask
    queue</a> is empty, jump to the <i>done</i> step below.</li>

    <li>Select the oldest <a>microtask</a> on the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>microtask
    queue</a>.</li>

    <li>Set the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>currently running task</a> to the <a>task</a> selected in the previous step.</li>

    <li>

    <i>Run</i>: Run the selected <a>task</a>.

    <p class="note">
  This might involve invoking scripted callbacks, which eventually calls the
    <a>clean up after running a callback</a> steps, which call this <a>perform a microtask
    checkpoint</a> algorithm again, which is why we use the <a>performing a microtask
    checkpoint</a> flag to avoid reentrancy.
  </p>

    </li>

    <li>Set the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>currently running task</a> back to
    null.</li>

    <li>Remove the <a>microtask</a> run in the step above from the <a>microtask
    queue</a>, and return to the <i>microtask queue handling</i> step.</li>

    <li><i>Done</i>: For each <a>environment settings object</a> whose <a>responsible
    event loop</a> is this <a>event loop</a>, <a>notify about rejected promises</a>
    on that <a>environment settings object</a>.</li>

    <li>Let the <a>performing a microtask checkpoint</a> flag be false.</li>

  </ol>

  If, while a <a>compound microtask</a> is running, the user agent is required to
  <dfn lt="wrap callbacks|execute a compound microtask subtask">execute a compound microtask subtask</dfn> to run a series of steps, the user agent must run
  the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>parent</var> be the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>currently running
    task</a> (the currently running <a>compound microtask</a>).</li>

    <li>Let <var>subtask</var> be a new <a>task</a> that
    consists of running the given series of steps. The <a>task source</a> of such a
    <a>microtask</a> is the <a>microtask task source</a>. This is a <dfn>compound
    microtask subtask</dfn>.</li>

    <li>Set the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>currently running task</a> to <var>subtask</var>.</li>

    <li>Run <var>subtask</var>.</li>

    <li>Set the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>currently running task</a> back to <var>parent</var>.</li>

  </ol>

  <hr />

  When an algorithm running <a>in parallel</a> is to <dfn lt="provides a stable state|await a stable state">await a stable state</dfn>, the
  user agent must <a>queue a microtask</a> that runs the following steps, and must then stop
  executing (execution of the algorithm resumes when the microtask is run, as described in the
  following steps):

  <ol>

    <li>Run the algorithm's <dfn lt="synchronous section|synchronous sections">synchronous section</dfn>.</li>

    <li>Resumes execution of the algorithm <a>in parallel</a>, if appropriate, as described

  <p class="note">
  Steps in <a>synchronous sections</a> are marked
  with &#x231B;.
  </p>

  <hr />

  When an algorithm says to <dfn lt="spinning the event loop|spin the event loop|spins the event loop">spin the event loop</dfn> until a condition <var>goal</var> is met, the user agent must run the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>

    Let <var>task</var> be the <a>event loop</a>'s <a>currently running
    task</a>.

    <p class="note">
  This might be a <a>microtask</a>, in which case it is a <a>solitary
    callback microtask</a>. It could also be a <a>compound microtask subtask</a>, or a
    regular <a>task</a> that is not a <a>microtask</a>. It will
    <em>not</em> be a <a>compound microtask</a>.
  </p>

    </li>

    <li>Let <var>task source</var> be <var>task</var>'s <a>task
    source</a>.</li>

    <li>Let <var>old stack of script settings objects</var> be a copy of the <a>stack
    of script settings objects</a>.</li>

    <li>Empty the <a>stack of script settings objects</a>.</li>

    <li><a>Run the global script clean-up jobs</a>.</li>

    <li><a>Perform a microtask checkpoint</a>.</li>

    <li>

    Stop <var>task</var>, allowing whatever algorithm that invoked it to resume, but
    continue these steps <a>in parallel</a>.

    <p class="note">
  This causes one of the following algorithms to continue: the <a>event loop</a>'s main set of steps, the <a>perform a microtask checkpoint</a> algorithm, or
    the <a>execute a compound microtask subtask</a> algorithm to continue.
  </p>

    </li>

    <li>Wait until the condition <var>goal</var> is met.</li>

    <li><a>Queue a task</a> to continue running these steps, using the <a>task

    these steps.</li>

    <li>Replace the <a>stack of script settings objects</a> with the <var>old
    stack of script settings objects</var>.</li>

    <li>Return to the caller.</li>

  </ol>

  <hr />

  Some of the algorithms in this specification, for historical reasons, require the user agent to
  <dfn state for="useragent" lt="Pause|pause">pause</dfn> while running a <a>task</a> until a condition <var>goal</var> is met. This means running the following steps:

  <ol>

    <li>If necessary, update the rendering or user interface of any <code>Document</code> or
    <a>browsing context</a> to reflect the current state.</li>

    <li>Wait until the condition <var>goal</var> is met. While a user agent has a paused
    <a>task</a>, the corresponding <a>event loop</a> must not run
    further <a>tasks</a>, and any script in the currently running <a>task</a> must block. User agents should remain responsive to user input
    while paused, however, albeit in a reduced capacity since the <a>event loop</a> will not be
    doing anything.</li>

<h5 id="generic-task-sources">Generic task sources</h5>

  The following <a>task sources</a> are used by a number of mostly
  unrelated features in this and other specifications.

  <dl>

    <dt>The <dfn>DOM manipulation task source</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    This <a>task source</a> is used for features that react to DOM manipulations, such as
    things that happen in a non-blocking fashion when an element is <a for="document">inserted into the document</a>.

    </dd>

    <dt>The <dfn>user interaction task source</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    This <a>task source</a> is used for features that react to user interaction, for
    example keyboard or mouse input.

    Events sent in response to user input (e.g. <code>click</code> events) must be fired using <a>tasks</a> <a>queued</a> with the <a>user
    interaction task source</a>. [[!UIEVENTS]]

    </dd>

    <dt>The <dfn>networking task source</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    This <a>task source</a> is used for features that trigger in response to network
    activity.

    </dd>

    <dt>The <dfn>history traversal task source</dfn></dt>

    <dd>

    This <a>task source</a> is used to queue calls to <code>history.back()</code> and similar APIs.

<h4 id="events">Events</h4>

<h5 id="events-event-handlers">Event handlers</h5>

  Many objects can have <dfn lt="event handler|event handlers">event handlers</dfn> specified. These act as non-capture event
  listeners for the object on which they are specified. [[!DOM]]

  An <a>event handler</a> has a name, which always starts with
  "<code>on</code>" and is followed by the name of the event for which it is intended.

  An <a>event handler</a> has a value, which is either null, or is a callback
  object<span class="impl">, or is an <a>internal raw uncompiled handler</a></span>. The
  <code>EventHandler</code> callback function type describes how this is exposed to scripts.
  <span class="impl">Initially, an <a>event handler</a>'s value must be set to null.</span>

  Event handlers are exposed in one of two ways.

  The first way, common to all event handlers, is as an <a>event handler IDL attribute</a>.

  The second way is as an <a>event handler content
  attribute</a>. Event handlers on <a>html elements</a> and some of the event handlers on
  <code>Window</code> objects are exposed in this way.

  <div class="impl">

  <hr />

  An <dfn for="event handler idl" lt="event handler IDL attribute|event handler IDL attributes">event handler IDL attribute</dfn> is an IDL
  attribute for a specific <a>event handler</a>. The name of the IDL
  attribute is the same as the name of the <a>event handler</a>.

  <a>Event handler IDL attributes</a>, on setting, must set the corresponding <a>event handler</a> to their new value, and on getting, must return the
  result of <a>getting the current value of the event handler</a> in question (this can throw
  an exception, in which case the getting propagates it to the caller, it does not catch it).

  If an <a>event handler IDL attribute</a> exposes an
  <a>event handler</a> of an object that doesn't exist, it must always
  return null on getting and must do nothing on setting.

  <p class="note">
  This can happen in particular for <a>event
  handler IDL attribute</a> on <{body}> elements that do not have corresponding
  <code>Window</code> objects.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
  Certain event handler IDL attributes have additional requirements, in particular
  the <code>onmessage</code> attribute of
  <code>MessagePort</code> objects.
  </p>

  <hr />

  </div>

  An <dfn for="event handler content" lt="event handler content attribute|event handler content attributes">event handler content attribute</dfn> is a
  content attribute for a specific <a>event handler</a>. The name of
  the content attribute is the same as the name of the <a>event
  handler</a>.

  <a>Event handler content attributes</a>, when specified, must contain valid JavaScript
  code which, when parsed, would match the <code>FunctionBody</code> production after
  automatic semicolon insertion. [[!ECMA-262]]

  <div class="impl">

  When an <a>event handler content attribute</a>
  is set, execute the following steps:</p>

  1. If the Should element's inline behavior be blocked by Content Security Policy? algorithm
      returns "<code>Blocked</code>" when executed upon the attribute's element and
      "<code>script attribute</code>", then abort these steps. [[CSP]]
  2. Set the corresponding <a>event handler</a> to an <a>internal raw uncompiled handler</a>
      consisting of the attribute's new value and the script location where the attribute was set to
      this value

  When an <a>event handler content attribute</a> is removed, the user agent must set the corresponding
  <a>event handler</a> to null.

  <hr />

  When an <a>event handler</a> <var>H</var> of an element
  or object <var>T</var> implementing the <code>EventTarget</code> interface is first set
  to a non-null value, the user agent must append an <a>event
  listener</a> to the list of <a>event listeners</a>
  associated with <var>T</var> with <i>type</i> set to the <dfn>event handler event
  type</dfn> corresponding to <var>H</var>, <i>capture</i> set to false, and
  <i>callback</i> set to <a>the event handler processing algorithm</a> defined below. [[!DOM]]

  <p class="note">
  The <i>callback</i> is emphatically <em>not</em> the <a>event handler</a> itself. Every event handler ends up registering the same
  <i>callback</i>, the algorithm defined below, which takes care of invoking the right callback, and
  processing the callback's return value.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
  This only happens the first time the <a>event
  handler</a>'s value is set. Since listeners are called in the order they were registered, the
  order of event listeners for a particular event type will always be first the event listeners
  registered with <code>addEventListener()</code> before
  the first time the <a>event handler</a> was set to a non-null value,
  then the callback to which it is currently set, if any, and finally the event listeners registered
  with <code>addEventListener()</code> <em>after</em> the
  first time the <a>event handler</a> was set to a non-null value.
  </p>

  </div>

  <div class="example">
    This example demonstrates the order in which event listeners are invoked. If the button in
    this example is clicked by the user, the page will show four alerts, with the text "ONE", "TWO",
    "THREE", and "FOUR" respectively.

    <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;button>Start Demo&lt;/button>
  &lt;script>
  var button = document.getElementById('test');
  button.addEventListener('click', function () { alert('ONE') }, false);
  button.setAttribute('onclick', "alert('NOT CALLED')"); // event handler listener is registered here
  button.addEventListener('click', function () { alert('THREE') }, false);
  button.onclick = function () { alert('TWO'); };

  &lt;/script>

  <dfn>The event handler processing algorithm</dfn> for an <a>event

    Process the <code>Event</code> object <var>E</var> as follows:

    <dl class="switch">

      <dt>If <var>E</var> is an <code>ErrorEvent</code> object and the <a>event handler IDL attribute</a>'s type is

      <dd>

      <a>Invoke</a> <var>callback</var> with five
      arguments, the first one having the value of <var>E</var>'s <code>message</code> attribute, the second having the value of

      having the value of <var>E</var>'s <code>lineno</code>
      attribute, the fourth having the value of <var>E</var>'s <code>colno</code> attribute, the fifth having the value of
      <var>E</var>'s <code>error</code> attribute, and with the <a spec="webidl">Callback this value</a> set to <var>E</var>'s <code>currentTarget</code>. Let <var>return value</var> be the

    In this step, <dfn>invoke</dfn> means to <a>invoke the Web IDL callback function</a>.

    If an exception gets thrown by the callback, end these steps and allow the exception to

  The <code>EventHandler</code> callback function type represents a callback used for event
  handlers. It is represented in Web IDL as follows:

  <pre class="idl" data-highlight="webidl" dfn-for="EventHandlerNonNull">
    [TreatNonObjectAsNull]
    callback EventHandlerNonNull = any (Event event);
    typedef EventHandlerNonNull? EventHandler;
  </pre>

  <p class="note">
  In JavaScript, any <code>Function</code> object implements
  this interface.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    For example, the following document fragment:

    <pre highlight="javascript">&lt;body onload="alert(this)" onclick="alert(this)"></pre>

    ...leads to an alert saying "<code>[object&nbsp;Window]</code>" when the document is
    loaded, and an alert saying "<code>[object&nbsp;HTMLBodyElement]</code>" whenever the
    user clicks something in the page.
  </div>

  <p class="note">
  The return value of the function affects whether the event is canceled or not:
  <span class="impl">as described above,</span> if the return value is false, the event is canceled
  (except for <code>mouseover</code> events, where the return value has to
  be true to cancel the event). With <code>beforeunload</code> events,
  the value is instead used to determine the message to show the user.
  </p>

  For historical reasons, the <code>onerror</code> handler has different
  arguments:

  <pre class="idl" data-highlight="webidl" dfn-for="OnErrorEventHandlerNonNull">
    [TreatNonObjectAsNull]
    callback OnErrorEventHandlerNonNull = any ((Event or DOMString) event, optional DOMString source, optional unsigned long lineno, optional unsigned long column, optional any error);
    typedef OnErrorEventHandlerNonNull? OnErrorEventHandler;
  </pre>

  Similarly, the <code>onbeforeunload</code> handler has a
  different return value:

  <pre class="idl" data-highlight="webidl" dfn-for="OnBeforeUnloadEventHandlerNonNull">
    [TreatNonObjectAsNull]
    callback OnBeforeUnloadEventHandlerNonNull = DOMString? (Event event);
    typedef OnBeforeUnloadEventHandlerNonNull? OnBeforeUnloadEventHandler;

  An <dfn>internal raw uncompiled handler</dfn> is a tuple with the following information:

<h5 id="event-firing">Event firing</h5>

  Certain operations and methods are defined as firing events on elements. For example, the <code>click()</code> method on the <code>HTMLElement</code> interface is defined as
  firing a <code>click</code> event on the element. [[!UIEVENTS]]

  <dfn lt="firing a simple event named e|firing a simple event">Firing a simple event named <var>e</var></dfn>
  means that a <a>trusted</a> event with the name <var>e</var>, which does not bubble (except where otherwise stated) and is not cancelable
  (except where otherwise stated), and which uses the <code>Event</code> interface, must be created
  and <a>dispatched</a> at the given target.

  <dfn lt="fire a synthetic mouse event named contextmenu|Firing a synthetic mouse event named e|firing a synthetic mouse event named click">Firing a synthetic mouse event named <var>e</var></dfn> means that an event with the name <var>e</var>, which is <a>trusted</a> (except where otherwise stated), does not bubble
  (except where otherwise stated), is not cancelable (except where otherwise stated), and which uses
  the <code>MouseEvent</code> interface, must be created and dispatched at the given target. The
  event object must have its <code>screenX</code>, <code>screenY</code>, <code>clientX</code>, <code>clientY</code>, and <code>button</code>
  attributes initialized to 0, its <code>ctrlKey</code>, <code>shiftKey</code>,
  <code>altKey</code>, and <code>metaKey</code> attributes initialized according
  to the current state of the key input device, if any (false for any keys that are not available),
  its <code>detail</code> attribute initialized to 1, its <code>relatedTarget</code> attribute initialized to null (except
  where otherwise stated), and its <code>view</code> attribute initialized to the <code>Window</code> object of the <code>Document</code> object of the given target node, if any, or else null. The <code>getModifierState()</code> method on the object must
  return values appropriately describing the state of the key input device at the time the event is
  created.

  <dfn lt="fire a click event|firing a click event">Firing a <code>click</code> event</dfn>
  means <a>firing a synthetic mouse event named <code>click</code></a>, which bubbles and is cancelable.

  The default action of these events is to do nothing except where otherwise stated.

<h5 id="events-and-the-window-object">Events and the <code>Window</code> object</h5>

  When an event is dispatched at a DOM node in a <code>Document</code> in a <a>browsing
  context</a>, if the event is not a <code>load</code> event, the user agent
  must act as if, for the purposes of <a>event dispatching</a>,
  the <code>Window</code> object is the parent of the <code>Document</code> object. [[!DOM]]

<h3 id="base64-utility-methods">Base64 utility methods</h3>

  The <code>atob()</code> and <code>btoa()</code> methods allow authors to transform content to and from
  the base64 encoding.

  In these APIs, for mnemonic purposes, the "b" can be considered to stand for

  <dl class="domintro">

    <dt><var>result</var> = <var>window</var> . <code>btoa</code>( <var>data</var> )</dt>

    Takes the input data, in the form of a Unicode string containing only characters in the range
    U+0000 to U+00FF, each representing a binary byte with values 0x00 to 0xFF respectively, and
    converts it to its base64 representation, which it returns.

    Throws an <code>InvalidCharacterError</code> exception if the input string contains any
    out-of-range characters.

    </dd>

    <dt><var>result</var> = <var>window</var> . <code>atob</code>( <var>data</var> )</dt>

    <dd>

    Takes the input data, in the form of a Unicode string containing base64-encoded binary data,
    decodes it, and returns a string consisting of characters in the range U+0000 to U+00FF, each
    representing a binary byte with values 0x00 to 0xFF respectively, corresponding to that binary
    data.

    Throws an <code>InvalidCharacterError</code> exception if the input string is not valid
    base64 data.

  <div class="impl">

  The <dfn method for="WindowBase64"><code>btoa()</code></dfn> method must throw an
  <code>InvalidCharacterError</code> exception if the method's first argument contains any character
  whose code point is greater than U+00FF. Otherwise, the user agent must convert that argument to a
  sequence of octets whose <var>n</var>th octet is the eight-bit representation of the code
  point of the <var>n</var>th character of the argument, and then must apply the base64
  algorithm to that sequence of octets, and return the result. [[!RFC4648]]

  The <dfn method for="WindowBase64"><code>atob()</code></dfn> method must run the following
  steps to parse the string passed in the method's first argument:

  <ol>

    <li>Let <var>input</var> be the string being parsed.</li>

    <li>Let <var>position</var> be a pointer into <var>input</var>, initially

    <li>If the length of <var>input</var> divides by 4 leaving no remainder, then: if
    <var>input</var> ends with one or two U+003D EQUALS SIGN (=) characters, remove them
    from <var>input</var>.</li>

    <li>If the length of <var>input</var> divides by 4 leaving a remainder of 1, throw an
    <code>InvalidCharacterError</code> exception and abort these steps.

    <li>

    If <var>input</var> contains a character that is not in the following list of
    characters and character ranges, throw an <code>InvalidCharacterError</code> exception and abort
    these steps:

    <li>Let <var>output</var> be a string, initially empty.</li>

    <li>Let <var>buffer</var> be a buffer that can have bits appended to it, initially
    empty.</li>

    <li>

    While <var>position</var> does not point past the end of <var>input</var>,

  The <dfn method for="document"><code>open()</code></dfn> method comes in several variants
  with different numbers of arguments.

  <dl class="domintro">

    <dt><var>document</var> = <var>document</var> . <code>open</code>( [ <var>type</var> [, <var>replace</var> ] ] )</dt>

    <dd>

    Causes the <code>Document</code> to be replaced in-place, as if it was a new
    <code>Document</code> object, but reusing the previous object, which is then returned.

    If the <var>type</var> argument is omitted or has the value
    "<a href="#text-html"><code>text/html</code></a>", then the resulting <code>Document</code> has an HTML parser associated
    with it, which can be given data to parse using <a method lt="write()"><code>document.write()</code></a>. Otherwise, all content passed to <a method lt="write()"><code>document.write()</code></a> will be parsed as plain text.

    If the <var>replace</var> argument is present and has the value "<code>replace</code>", the existing entries in the session history for the
    <code>Document</code> object are removed.

    The method has no effect if the <code>Document</code> is still being parsed.

    Throws an <code>InvalidStateError</code> exception if the <code>Document</code> is an <a>XML document</a>.

    </dd>

    <dt><var>window</var> = <var>document</var> . <code>open</code>( <var>url</var>, <var>name</var>, <var>features</var> [, <var>replace</var> ] )</dt>

    Works like the <code>window.open()</code> method.

    </dd>

  </dl>

  <div class="impl">

  <code>Document</code> objects have an <dfn>ignore-opens-during-unload counter</dfn>, which is
  used to prevent scripts from invoking the <code>document.open()</code>
  method (directly or indirectly) while the document is <a>being unloaded</a>. Initially, the counter must be set to zero.

  When called with two arguments (or fewer), the <code>document.open()</code>
  method must act as follows:

  <ol>

    <li>If the <code>Document</code> object is not flagged as an <a>HTML
    document</a>, throw an <code>InvalidStateError</code> exception and abort these steps.</li>

    <li>If the <code>Document</code> object is not an <a>active document</a>, then abort

    Otherwise, if the <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>session history</a> contains only

    </li>

    <li>

    If the <code>Document</code> has an <a>active parser</a> whose <a>script nesting
    level</a> is greater than zero, then the method does nothing. Abort these steps and return
    the <code>Document</code> object on which the method was invoked.

    <p class="note">
  This basically causes <code>document.open()</code> to

  </p>

    <li>

    Remove all the entries in the <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>session history</a>

  <div class="impl">

  When the <dfn><code>print()</code></dfn> method is invoked, if the

  physical form (e.g. PDF copy), of a document.

  The <dfn>printing steps</dfn> are as follows:

  <ol>

    <li>

    The user agent may display a message to the user or abort these steps (or both).

    <p class="example">
  For instance, a kiosk browser could silently ignore any invocations of the

    <p class="example">
  The <code>beforeprint</code> event can be used to

    <li>

    The user agent should offer the user the opportunity to <a>obtain a physical form</a>

    to either accept or decline before returning; if so, the user agent must <a state for="useragent">pause</a>
    while the method is waiting. Even if the user agent doesn't wait at this point, the user agent
    must use the state of the relevant documents as they are at this point in the algorithm if and

    </li>

    <li>

    The user agent must <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>afterprint</code> at the <code>Window</code> object of the

    <p class="example">
  The <code>afterprint</code> event can be used to

    Whenever the user agent needs to make the <code>navigator.languages</code> attribute of a <code>Window</code>

    <li>Any information in this API that varies from user to user can be used to profile or identify
    the user.

    </li>

    <li>If the user is not using a service that obfuscates the user's point of origin (e.g. the Tor
    anonymity network), then the value that is least likely to distinguish the user from other users
    with similar origins (e.g. from the same IP address block) is the language used by the majority
    of such users. [[TOR]]</li>

    <li>If the user is using an anonymizing service, then the value "<code>en-US</code>" is
    suggested; if all users of the service use that same value, that reduces the possibility of
    distinguishing the users from each other.</li>

  </ul>

  To avoid introducing any more fingerprinting vectors, user agents should use the same list for
  the APIs defined in this function as for the HTTP <code>Accept-Language</code> header.

  User agents may, within the constraints described in this section, do whatever they like when
  the methods are called. A user agent could, for instance, prompt the user and offer the user the
  opportunity to add the site to a shortlist of handlers, or make the handlers his default, or
  cancel the request. user agents could provide such a UI through modal UI or through a non-modal transient
  notification interface. user agents could also simply silently collect the information, providing it only
  when relevant to the user.

  User agents should keep track of which sites have registered handlers (even if the user has
  declined such registrations) so that the user is not repeatedly prompted with the same
  request.

  The arguments to the methods have the following meanings and corresponding implementation
  requirements. The requirements that involve throwing exceptions must be processed in the order
  given below, stopping at the first exception thrown. (So the exceptions for the first argument
  take precedence over the exceptions for the second argument.)

  <dl>

    <dt><var>scheme</var> (<code>registerProtocolHandler()</code> only)</dt>

    <dd>

    A scheme, such as "<code>mailto</code>" or "<code>web+auth</code>". The
    scheme must be compared in an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> manner by user agents for the
    purposes of comparing with the scheme part of URLs that they consider against the list of
    registered handlers.

    The <var>scheme</var> value, if it contains a colon (as in "<code>mailto:</code>"),
    will never match anything, since schemes don't contain colons.

    If the <code>registerProtocolHandler()</code>
    method is invoked with a scheme that is neither a <a>safelisted scheme</a> nor a scheme
    whose value starts with the substring "<code>web+</code>" and otherwise contains only
    <a>lowercase ASCII letters</a>, and whose length is at least five characters (including
    the "<code>web+</code>" prefix), the user agent must throw a <code>SecurityError</code>
    exception.

    The following schemes are the <dfn>safelisted schemes</dfn>:

  This list excludes any schemes that could reasonably be expected to be supported

    used in man-in-the-middle attacks, by replacing pages that have frames with such content with
    content under the control of the protocol handler. If the user agent has native support for the
    schemes, this could further be used for cookie-theft attacks.

    </dd>

    <dt><var>mimeType</var> (<code>registerContentHandler()</code> only)</dt>

    <dd>

    A <a>MIME type</a>, such as <code>model/vnd.flatland.3dml</code> or <code>application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml</code>. The <a>MIME type</a> must be
    compared in an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> manner by user agents for the purposes of
    comparing with MIME types of documents that they consider against the list of registered
    handlers.

    User agents must compare the given values only to the MIME type/subtype parts of content
    types, not to the complete type including parameters. Thus, if <var>mimeType</var>
    values passed to this method include characters such as commas or whitespace, or include MIME
    parameters, then the handler being registered will never be used.

    <p class="note">
  The type is compared to the <a>MIME type</a> used by the user agent

    <dt><var>url</var></dt>

    <dd>

    A string used to build the <a for="url">URL</a> of the page that will handle the requests.

    User agents must throw a <code>SyntaxError</code> exception if the <var>url</var>
    argument passed to one of these methods does not contain the exact literal string
    "<code>%s</code>".

    User agents must throw a <code>SyntaxError</code> exception if <a>resolving</a> the <var>url</var> argument relative to the <a>API base
    URL</a> specified by the <a>entry settings object</a> is not successful.

    <p class="note">
  The <a>resulting absolute URL</a> would by definition not be a <a>valid
    URL</a> as it would include the string "<code>%s</code>" which is not a valid
    component in a URL.
  </p>

    User agents must throw a <code>SecurityError</code> exception if the resulting <a>absolute
    URL</a> has an <a spec="fetch">origin</a> that differs from the <a spec="fetch">origin</a> specified by the
    <a>entry settings object</a>.

    <p class="note">
  This is forcibly the case if the <code>%s</code> placeholder is in the
    scheme, host, or port parts of the URL.
  </p>

    The <a>resulting absolute URL</a> is the <dfn>proto-URL</dfn>. It identifies the
    handler for the purposes of the methods described below.

    When the user agent uses this handler, it must replace the first occurrence of the exact
    literal string "<code>%s</code>" in the <var>url</var> argument with an
    escaped version of the <a>absolute URL</a> of the content in question (as defined below),
    then <a>resolve</a> the resulting URL, relative to the <a>API
    base URL</a> specified by the <a>entry settings object</a> at the time the <code>registerContentHandler()</code> or <code>registerProtocolHandler()</code> methods were
    invoked, and then <a>navigate</a> an appropriate <a>browsing
    context</a> to the resulting URL.

    To get the escaped version of the <a>absolute URL</a> of the content in question, the
    user agent must replace every character in that <a>absolute URL</a> that is not a
    character in the URL <a>default encode set</a> with the result of <a lt="utf-8 percent encode">UTF-8 percent encoding</a> that character.

    <div class="example">
      If the user had visited a site at <code>http://example.com/</code> that made the
      following call:

      <pre highlight="javascript">navigator.registerContentHandler('application/x-soup', 'soup?url=%s', 'SoupWeb&trade;')</pre>

      ...and then, much later, while visiting <code>http://www.example.net/</code>,
      clicked on a link such as:

      <pre highlight="html">
  &lt;a href="chickenk&#xEF;wi.soup">Download our Chicken K&#xEF;wi soup!&lt;/a>
  </pre>

      ...then, assuming this <code>chickenk&#xEF;wi.soup</code> file was served with the
      <a>MIME type</a> <code>application/x-soup</code>, the user agent might navigate to the
      following URL:

      <pre>http://example.com/soup?url=http://www.example.net/chickenk%C3%AFwi.soup</pre>

      This site could then fetch the <code>chickenk&#xEF;wi.soup</code> file and do
      whatever it is that it does with soup (synthesize it and ship it to the user, or whatever).
    </div>

    </dd>

    <dt><var>title</var></dt>

    <dd>

    A descriptive title of the handler, which the user agent might use to remind the user what the site
    in question is.

    </dd>

  </dl>

  This section does not define how the pages registered by these methods are used, beyond the
  requirements on how to process the <var>url</var> value (see above). To some extent, the
  <a>processing model for navigating across documents</a> defines some cases
  where these methods are relevant, but in general user agents may use this information wherever they would
  otherwise consider handing content to native plugins or helper applications.

  user agents must not use registered content handlers to handle content that was returned as part of a
  non-GET transaction (or rather, as part of any non-idempotent transaction), as the remote site
  would not be able to fetch the same data.

  <div class="impl">
    <h6 id="security-and-privacy">Security and privacy</h6>

      These mechanisms can introduce a number of concerns, in particular privacy concerns.

      <strong>Hijacking all Web usage.</strong> User agents should not allow schemes that are key to
      its normal operation, such as <code>http</code> or <code>https</code>, to be
      rerouted through third-party sites. This would allow a user's activities to be trivially tracked,
      and would allow user information, even in secure connections, to be collected.

      <strong>Hijacking defaults.</strong> User agents are strongly urged to not automatically change
      any defaults, as this could lead the user to send data to remote hosts that the user is not
      expecting. New handlers registering themselves should never automatically cause those sites to be
      used.

      <strong>Registration spamming.</strong> User agents should consider the possibility that a site
      will attempt to register a large number of handlers, possibly from multiple domains (e.g. by
      redirecting through a series of pages each on a different domain, and each registering a handler
      for <code>video/mpeg</code> &mdash; analogous practices abusing other Web browser features have
      been used by pornography Web sites for many years). User agents should gracefully handle such
      hostile attempts, protecting the user.

      <strong>Misleading titles.</strong> User agents should not rely wholly on the <var>title</var>
      argument to the methods when presenting the registered handlers to the user, since sites could
      easily lie. For example, a site <code>hostile.example.net</code> could claim that it was
      registering the "Cuddly Bear Happy Content Handler". User agents should therefore use the
      handler's domain in any UI along with any title.

      <strong>Hostile handler metadata.</strong> User agents should protect against typical attacks
      against strings embedded in their interface, for example ensuring that markup or escape characters
      in such strings are not executed, that null bytes are properly handled, that over-long strings do
      not cause crashes or buffer overruns, and so forth.

      <strong>Leaking Intranet URLs.</strong> The mechanism described in this section can result in
      secret Intranet URLs being leaked, in the following manner:

      <ol>

        <li>The user registers a third-party content handler as the default handler for a content
        type.</li>

        <li>The user then browses his corporate Intranet site and accesses a document that uses that
        content type.</li>

        <li>The user agent contacts the third party and hands the third party the URL to the Intranet
        content.</li>

      </ol>

      No actual confidential file data is leaked in this manner, but the URLs themselves could
      contain confidential information. For example, the URL could be <code>http://www.corp.example.com/upcoming-aquisitions/the-sample-company.egf</code>, which
      might tell the third party that Example Corporation is intending to merge with The Sample Company.
      Implementors might wish to consider allowing administrators to disable this feature for certain
      subdomains, content types, or schemes.

      <strong>Leaking secure URLs.</strong> User agents should not send HTTPS URLs to third-party
      sites registered as content handlers without the user's informed consent, for the same reason that
      user agents sometimes avoid sending <code>Referer</code> (sic) HTTP
      headers from secure sites to third-party sites.

      <strong>Leaking credentials.</strong> User agents must never send username or password
      information in the URLs that are escaped and included sent to the handler sites. User agents may
      even avoid attempting to pass to Web-based handlers the URLs of resources that are known to
      require authentication to access, as such sites would be unable to access the resources in
      question without prompting the user for credentials themselves (a practice that would require the
      user to know whether to trust the third-party handler, a decision many users are unable to make or
      even understand).

      <strong>Interface interference.</strong> User agents should be prepared to handle intentionally
      long arguments to the methods. For example, if the user interface exposed consists of an "accept"
      button and a "deny" button, with the "accept" binding containing the name of the handler, it's
      important that a long name not cause the "deny" button to be pushed off the screen.

      <strong>Fingerprinting users.</strong> Since a site can detect if it has attempted to register
      a particular handler or not, whether or not the user responds, the mechanism can be used to store
      data. User agents are therefore strongly urged to treat registrations in the same manner as
      cookies: clearing cookies for a site should also clear all registrations for that site, and
      disabling cookies for a site should also disable registrations.

<h6 id="sample-user-interface">Sample user interface</h6>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  A simple implementation of this feature for a desktop Web browser might work as follows.

  The <code>registerContentHandler()</code> method
  could display a modal dialog box:

  <img src="images/sample-content-handler-registration.png" width="534" height="374" alt="The modal dialog box could have the title 'Content Handler Registration', and could say 'This Web page: Kittens at work http://kittens.example.org/ ...would like permission to handle files of type: application/x-meowmeow using the following Web-based application: Kittens-at-work displayer http://kittens.example.org/?show=%s Do you trust the administrators of the &quot;kittens.example.org&quot; domain?' with two buttons, 'Trust kittens.example.org' and 'Cancel'." />

  In this dialog box, "Kittens at work" is the title of the page that invoked the method,
  "http://kittens.example.org/" is the URL of that page, "application/x-meowmeow" is the string that
  was passed to the <code>registerContentHandler()</code> method as its first
  argument (<var>mimeType</var>), "http://kittens.example.org/?show=%s" was the second
  argument (<var>url</var>), and "Kittens-at-work displayer" was the third argument (<var>title</var>).

  If the user clicks the Cancel button, then nothing further happens. If the user clicks the
  "Trust" button, then the handler is remembered.

  When the user then attempts to fetch a URL that uses the "application/x-meowmeow" <a>MIME
  type</a>, then it might display a dialog as follows:

  <img src="images/sample-content-handler.png" width="577" height="428" alt="The dialog box could have the title 'Unknown File Type' and could say 'You have attempted to access:' followed by a URL, followed by a prompt such as 'How would you like FerretBrowser to handle this resource?' with three radio buttons, one saying 'Contact the FerretBrowser plugin registry to see if there is an official way to handle this resource.', one saying 'Pass this URL to a local application' with an application selector, and one saying 'Pass this URL to the &quot;Kittens-at-work displayer&quot; application at &quot;kittens.example.org&quot;', with a checkbox labeled 'Always do this for resources using the &quot;application/x-meowmeow&quot; type in future.', and with two buttons, 'Ok' and 'Cancel'." />

  In this dialog, the third option is the one that was primed by the site registering itself
  earlier.

  If the user does select that option, then the browser, in accordance with the requirements
  described in the previous two sections, will redirect the user to
  "http://kittens.example.org/?show=data%3Aapplication/x-meowmeow;base64,S2l0dGVucyBhcmUgdGhlIGN1dGVzdCE%253D".

  The <code>registerProtocolHandler()</code> method
  would work equivalently, but for schemes instead of unknown content types.

  increases the number of bits that can be derived for fingerprinting. Hiding a plugin helps, but
  unless it is an extremely rare plugin, it is likely that a site attempting to derive the list of
  plugins can still determine whether the plugin is supported or not by probing for it by name (the

  An <code>ImageBitmap</code> object represents a bitmap image that can be painted to a canvas
  without undue latency.

  <p class="note">
  The exact judgement of what is undue latency of this is left up to the
  implementer, but in general if making use of the bitmap requires network I/O, or even local disk
  I/O, then the latency is probably undue; whereas if it only requires a blocking read from a GPU or
  system RAM, the latency is probably acceptable.
